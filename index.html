<p>
My immediate response to what I can do to lower my carbon footprint is exactly what Ken laid out: that's it? I'm already doing all of that! And I know many others are going to experience the same thing, so I'm going to take the liberty to draw out some extra steps you can take. 
<br><br>

Eating
<br><br>

Eat local! Not only are you supporting your neighbors, but you're also supporting the environment. An apple from the local farmer's market has a lower carbon trail than an apple from Safeway. Also, getting food from farmer's markets are likely to promote a plant-based seasonal diet that's better for you anyway. There's a farmer's market every Sunday in the Costco lot. They even accept EBT, and the bus goes straight there.
<br><br>
Even more local than the farmer's market is your own backyard. Growing your own food is rewarding and great for the Earth. You probably live in a dorm now, but there's a campus garden where you can rent lots. You can get free seeds at the seed bank (located in the AS food bank) daily. You can grow small plants on your desk or windowsill.
<br><br>
Also, avoid palm oil. Even if the bag says it's sustainably sourced, it isn't. (Plus, you know foods with palm oil aren't good for you anyway.)
<br><br>
The Dining Commons just sent out a survey to your email. Let them know you want sustainably sourced, local, plant-based foods.

<br><br>

Transportation
<br><br>
Support public transportation efforts. Vote for them, campaign for them, or just help out people who don't know how to use them yet. Also support bikes or skateboards. Some lots or strip malls have minimal bike parking or ban skateboards. Email the owners and tell them it's dumb.
<br><br>
If you live in a place where public transportation isn't an option (my parents live on the top of a mountain), stay in contact with your neighbors. You can carpool, or do errands for each other, which could end up cutting car trips significantly. (Plus, it's just nice to know your neighbors, so you can trade things like in Animal Crossing. Our neighbor gives us her fresh eggs for our fresh apples.)
<br><br>


Rethinking Stuff
<br><br>
I would suggest reading Marie Kondo's book or watching her series on Netflix. She knows what's up.
<br><br>
Also, thrifting is just plain fun! It's a treasure hunt. You may not always be able to find the perfect thing, but that's okay. Learn to customize not perfect things so they are. Alter shirts, or repaint dressers.
<br><br>


Housing
<br><br>
Just moving to the city does not change the fact that the house you may already have exists and someone is bound to live there. There's no use in wasting a house that already exists. Instead, try and find more people to live with you. Major construction isn't even needed for privacy. Paper screens and curtains work too. Plus, living with others is really good for your mental health. :)


<br><br>
Kids
<br><br>
So, you want more than 2 kids? Adopt. Adopt! There are so many children right now who need a home, and you want another kid, what a perfect match! This adds nothing to the carbon footprint of the human race and makes sure a child grows up with a family. There is literally no downside to this. 

<br><br>

I hope some of my ideas work for you and help you do more, so you feel less helpless. I fully invite others to let me know your ideas as well! I always want to do more.

I really love the way that you think. After reading your advice on what we can do to lower our carbon footprint, I gained a whole new perspective on how making a little effort on our daily routine really have. It is like what Ken said "If acted on, knowledge is power. If not, knowledge is power squander."

<br><Hr>
It’s pretty cool that so many of our generation think Ken’s steps to living a more climate-friendly life are so easy! When I heard them, I also felt like “that’s it?” because I already do them. But, when thinking about my parents, I can definitely see how it would be much harder for them to accept some of these. I really like how this comment added on some options to think about, like just living with more people or some options for us here in Santa Barbara. Just seeing where and how to make these choices is so helpful and can often give you a new idea you hadn’t thought of! I have a few add ons:
<br><br>

I highly recommend the GHGP garden plots by Harder stadium (they’re just $40 a year and you can split one with your friends!) and trying to grow your own food. I’ve also seen some amazing gardening achievements on Isla Vista balconies.
<br><br>

Try not to waste food, but compost what you can’t eat! There are several places in Isla Vista where you can also drop off home compost.
<br><br>

There are multiple thrift stores in old town Goleta that you can take the bus to, where you can find a lot of cool things and lots of furniture/household things.
<br><br>

Go to Green Monday in the dining commons! Show your support for plant-based menus/options.
<br><br>

Try to buy less plastic, as it’s also made from fossil fuels. IV Co-Op and Sprouts have bulk sections where you can fill up reusable jars/bags.
<br><br>

Turn off your lights/appliances when you’re not using them.
<br><br>

Opt for reusable options instead of disposables (razors, plasticware, makeup wipes, etc., can often be cheaper in the long run too).
<br><br>

If you have a little more time: join an activist organization or donate a little bit to them! People power can achieve more institutional change.
<br><br>

It can be frustrating to learn that the climate crisis was brought about and people knew about it, and yet there’s still barely any large-scale action, but it helps to know there’s steps we can take. When we do this stuff ourselves, it also inspires people around us to follow suit, so we can have a huge impact. We’re lucky that we’re in a place right now where we still have time to make a lot of these decisions, like where to move after university, compared to older generations who might have their lives much more settled.
<br><Hr>
I agree with you. Here is my plan to lower my carbon footprint in the future:

<br><br>

Eating- I plan on returning to a plant-based vegan diet. I used to be on one but I quit because it was pretty hard here at college in the dining commons, but now that I live on my own in Isla Vista I feel it will be easier.
<br><br>


Transportation- I walk, bike, or take public transport almost everywhere I go. When I do drive, I typically am in a car full of people. This is good since it is maximizing space in the car and limiting the number of separate Co2-emitting vehicles on the road at once.
<br><br>


Rethinking Stuff- I love thrifting! Fast fashion is a cancer. It is good to reuse, rewear, and donate your old clothing. Plus its fun and trendy now, which is awesome!
<br><br>


Housing: Although I would love a nice, big, beautiful home, I realize it is unnecessary, flashy, and bad for the environment. I plan on living a minimalist lifestyle, now.


Kids-
<br><br>
I want to adopt and have my own. Fostering is a great option too. Foster kids deserve a loving home and to be treated with just as much dignity as any non-foster child.
<br><Hr>
 not only was your response enlightening and eye-opening, but it was also very enjoyable to see such passion in word-form. It's great to hear about the small environmentally-friendly things that you currently take part in, such as exchanging goods with your neighbors (fun and friendly!!), and I appreciate the fact that you're sharing them with our class. I hope that others can take from your comment, as it lists many ways in which we can prevent our carbon footprint from worsening!
<br><Hr>
Thanks for the tips! I think it'd be really great if things like this would be announced more and put out there more so more people would be aware and be encouraged to follow these things! As easy as it is to blame the boomer generation for all this mess, we also need to do something ourselves. Sometimes when I think about how big this problem is, I feel helpless and freak out, but being reminded of changing up my lifestyle to lessen my carbon footprint makes me feel better because I CAN do something. We all should do something and the first step, I believe, is to at least start with the individual--start with yourself because after all, climate change is anthropogenic. 
<br><br>
I also liked how you mentioned thrifting. I began thrifting ever since I had found out about fast fashion recently-- I had no idea that fast fashion had such a huge negative impact on our environment.
<br><Hr>
I love the examples that you give that can easily be put into use by college students. I knew about the Farmer’s Market on the weekends and have gone on several occasions, but I had no clue about the campus garden. I also frequent the Isla Vista Co-op because it’s walking distance from my dorm and the produce that’s available there is so much better than many of the items that are sold in other grocery stores. 
<br><br>
For transportation, I prefer to walk most places and if it’s long distances within Santa Barbara, then I’ll definitely take the bus. When I go back home during break, I always take the Amtrak home and coming back because it’s a much better alternative than driving all the way down to San Diego, even if it is a six hour train ride.
<br><Hr>
Man I totally love your energy! It reminds me that, even though the problem seems big, there are actually things we can all do that (by themselves even!) have a pretty substantial impact. I didn't even think about adoption when watching the video. The thought of how many children i'd wan't when the time comes hasn't really crossed my mind, but I'm definitely more open to the idea of adoption in the future. 
<br><br>

Overall I dig what this class is making me do. Not only is it pushing me to reflect on my beliefs and motives, but I am actually coming to appreciate parts of my life I used to not enjoy. Growing up i always hated getting hand me downs from my older brother. My freshman year of college i was envious of my older friends who had cars to drive around and get to places faster. Like oh man would groceries be easier if I could just yeet over to costco myself. All this time, I didn't realize but reusing old clothes, not using a car for small distances, carpooling with roommates, all these things unknowingly help to secure a brighter future for the next generation; and this is all actions being done unknowingly, imagine if i put more drive into one of the 5 things mentioned! 
<br><br>

Circling back to the end of this video, the last point about knowledge is very uplifting and almost sobering in a sense. I think the biggest takeaway from this class by the end of the quarter will be how we choose to act on based on the information we have been entrusted with. I just hope I can keep up this same drive.
<br><Hr>
I smiled finish reading your comments, you gave me a lot of good advises about where to start to lower my carbon footprints and fight against the climate change. Hell, I was pretty lost about what I should actually do besides some simple, well-known things. But then I am glad to know that I am already doing some of the things that help.

<br><br>

Eating: I am slowly adapting to a vegan diet nowadays, and it's working pretty good in my opinion. Now that I know it's better to buy and eat local, I will definitely do some research about farms nearby and try buy from them now.
<br><br>


Transportation: I am biking to campus everyday for a long time now (duh), just like many of UCSB's students. I am even planning to sell my own car since I am not really using it very much. After graduation I will stick to public transportation even though I never find the needs to use them.
<br><br>


Rethinking Stuffs: Never tried thrifting before but it sounds like something that will be fun and meaningful, I think I can start considering about cancelling my Amazon prime now.
<br><br>


Housing: I live with a roommate in an apartment, but then I personally think that the base line of privacy will be different for everyone, so I don't see much we can do about having more people than dedicated rooms living in a same apartment/houses.
<br><br>


Kids: I don't even want kids, but then again, lowering the birth rate is definitely going to impact the economics. Not saying that it's not a necessary step to slow down climate changes, but it's one thing that most last-gen politicians won't agree on about, and something we need to work on.
<br><br>


Finally: I am grateful to read something inspired :D   and the last thing I need to learn is your attitude.
<br><Hr>

Wow. I love this. Thank you so much for sharing! I learned quite a bit.

<br><Hr>
This comment is fabulous. I too feel like I am already doing many of the methinks Ken mentioned (although they are very important to keep in mind and great first steps). I have been working on implementing many of the things in this comment into my life, and Isla Vista and UCSB have many many resources to help with it like the food bank, multiple community gardens, EBT offices, IV trading posts and other pop up thrifts and much more. One thing that I think is worth mentioning is that we really need to use less. Ken mentions this when talking about that people from the US generally buy 60 new items of clothing pwe year. But although it is extremely important to switch to renewable anger and used items, it is really really important to just consume less. Borrow things you don't use all of the time. create a meal plan that utilizes the food you have and does not create wast. get reusable produce bags for shopping. If you have to drive, carpool!
<br><Hr>
I really like your enthusiasm! I think optimism is a topic that the professor tries to constantly bring back up. It is hard to remain optimistic in all the distressing facts that we are presented with, but we need optimism in order to keep moving forward, particularly in the case of the climate crisis. There are many ways which we can help in responding to the climate crisis. The 5 points that the professor mentioned was very straight forward and seems easy, and your ideas greatly supplement what the professor mentioned. I am a huge advocate of public transportation and I'm glad that you brought up supporting public transportation efforts. If there is more access to public transportation, people will most likely utilize that resource. Carpooling is also a very good idea that you mentioned, especially for areas that do not have close or immediate access to public transportation.
<br><br>
An interesting argument that older generations have in response to these 5 options is interesting, as it's rooted in the argument of losing individual "freedoms." However, this is ironic because it is the very corporations who pollute the environment that are doing so on the basis of "freedom," which would include the free markets in this case. Therefore, older generations do not see that those who they are fighting for are the ones who are compromising their very own "freedom."
<br><br>
The professor brought up the American lifestyle, which I think is a very important factor that contributes to out current climate crisis. The American 'lifestyle' is centered around mass production and over consumerism, which stems from capitalist values and the way it functions in society. As people realize that such a lifestyle is unsustainable, I think the very ethics of American values is questioned, which I think is very important in order to drive change.
<br><br>
Sometimes advocating for the protection of the planet does get discouraging, and this video specifically frustrated me because people have known about the potentials of human activity from back to the 1850s. That is almost 170 years of knowing of the potentials of human activity on the environment, and the climate crisis began around 110 years after this discovery. However, as the professor said, knowledge is not power until we act on it, and I think the most important thing we can do is act on what we have learned about climate change. Otherwise, everything we have learned won't mean anything unless we do something, as people have not in the past.
<br><Hr>
Just like you I also thought to myself, is that all it takes in order to help and drop carbon emission rates? Then I really started to think about all the these things individually and how I felt about each and how society sees those things in our everyday lives. Most of the things that were mentioned to drop carbon emissions are of complete opposite of what our capitalistic  lifestyle promote. In the form of movies and USA culture, we have this ideal of looking forward to getting your own car since that meant a sign of independence and growing up. We also constantly see advertisements of new cars coming out, and this portrayal that getting a car allows you to travel the world and see all you want, and support this idea that owning a car is so important and the best way of travel. Now in regards to housing, we also have this idea that "bigger is better" and that the "American Dream" is that of having so much money and owning the biggest house and have many cars. Now these are just a few examples of what we as the population of the United States see constantly on social media and TV, and you realize that trying to convince the general public of changing our ways is something very hard and something that businesses and corporations will fight against. Nonetheless, I agree that we should do what's best in our power to lower our carbon footprint and try to educate society of the dangerous effects of our everyday commodities.
<br><Hr>
Such a good comment. Thanks for starting a space to throw helpful and practical ideas around.
<br><br>

I'm getting married, and I feel like I'm going to be facing the same questions as my parents do soon. How does the way I raise a family impact the environment? It's a part of wrestling to build a shared life with another person, and I think my generation knows how to do that wrestling in a more conscientious way. I think my choices to prioritize adoption and a small home and honeymoon local aren't radical or unique, and that makes me really happy.
<br><br>

I think sometimes, those priorities feel like bonuses to my parents, like something that is great, if it works out, almost like a halfhearted diet (sometimes very literally a halfhearted diet). It's like climate change is a recognized threat, but it's just pretty far down on the list, like preventative healthcare. I'll go to the dentist when I get a chance.
<br><br>

It's the delayed effect we've been talking about. Our parents didn't go to the dentist because their teeth weren't hurting, and now we're gonna have to get more than a few pulled.
<br><Hr>
I think it's really great how you took the time to think up your own ideas for mitigating climate change on an individual level, and even specified things here in our community on campus and around Santa Barbara. I definitely agree with you that more people should utilize farmer's markets! Buying the fresh, local food is good for the environment (less carbon trail like you mentioned), your body, and local business. I also love how there are campus and community gardens, and I've really wanted to learn more about them and how to get involved. The Santa Barbara MTD bus system is also very useful and it's great how they've made it free for all students to ride, I think that is an effective incentive. I love how so many students here ride bikes, skateboards, the bus, etc. I also like your view on adoption, I feel like that is an option that not many people consider, and like you explained, it's both logical and ethical. Overall, I think your ideas were realistic and optimistic, and I genuinely appreciate your effort and contribution!
<br><Hr>
This is similar to what was outlined in “We are the Weather,” which EVERYONE should read. I think the biggest issue people are going to have is that it isn't all on them. And a lot of ways its a valid argument. People aren't good at self-regulating, and so to expect that the number of people needed to make change will take this advice seriously enough to shift the supply and demand, is a hard thing to believe. However, we’ve seen it done. Just last year the largest milk company went bankrupt because of all the alternatives like Oatly. Personally, I saw the ads on my way to school every day, and they were funny enough to grab attention, and apparently effective enough to change people's habits. That's the biggest difference. People will do what they are used to, or, the easiest thing. Ideally, the laws would come from higher up so that it didn't feel too against the flow to change the way we lived, but sometimes people have to take the individual initiative.
<br><Hr>
I really appreciate all the extra steps you added. Living in the apartments in IV, makes it really hard to even consider growing my own food. I was very surprised to learn that I could rent space in the campus garden. My friend Alex actually works for the food bank and was the one who actually convinced the AS food bank to start providing the seeds so I am planning on trying out gardening sometime. I would add on to your point about adopting kids. I do agree that it is the right decision to adopt if you want more than two kids but right now the process is too difficult and expensive to actually adopt. I think alongside to adopting, we should be advocating for an easier adoption.
<br><br>
I really liked Ken’s comment of "If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered." I think just from your comment alone, I know that you did not squander your power of everything you know about being more eco friendly! Thank you for giving me more ideas on how to be more environmentally friendly.

<br><Hr>
I strongly agree with your statement about adoption. There are so many children in this world who don't have a home, living off very little. There are couples who spend thousands and thousand of dollars to create biological children when there are children living under the foster care system, deprived of so much. 
<br><br>

Also I agree with your housing statement. It isn't difficult to minimize the are that we live in. We're doing that right now as college students. Wether we're living in the on campus dorms or squeezed into a large house of 13 on DP, it's not too bad. In fact, many might say that it's better than having a large house to ourselves. 
<br><br>

This lifestyle does encourage more communication with everything around you. You can help save the planet with your neighbors. For example, if you need an evening dress for one single occasion, instead of going out to buy a dress you'll only use once, you can ask you neighbor during your carpool to work if she has something that you can borrow. Sharing is caring.

<br><Hr>
This, this is a good comment. I'd just like to add one thing: if you have something like a bike, or clothes, or headphones already, don't feel obligated to throw it away because it wasn't produced in an environmental way. Often, throwing it away quite literally throws it into our environment, and the carbon footprint of replacing it, if you do, will probably be much greater than simply continuing to use it.
<br><Hr>
I am so glad you put up more suggestions for living with a lower carbon footprint. If I could just make one more note it would be to compost! There was a composting group, the IVCC, that would distribute buckets and pick up your compost each week for a small fee but it is not running this quarter due to lack of funding. However, you can still acquire your own buckets and bring your compost to the Church in IV. I was surprised by how much food could be composted…..and it helps with ants.
<br><br>

 To address the other aspect of his lecture, regarding the boomer generation’s knowledge of climate change and response, or lack thereof, I was again disappointed to be reminded of their refusal to take substantial action against climate change. I know that I do not perfectly adhere to all of the elements on Ken’s list that would reduce my carbon footprint (I enjoy eating meat and tend to buy my clothes off the rack) but I do try to be conscientious of how my actions affect my environment. Hopefully listening to the mistakes of the past generation will inspire me to behave in a more environmentally friendly manner.

<br><Hr>
I really like all of these suggestions! Not only did you provide a list of things to do, but you also explained how these things could be implemented practically, even as a college student at UCSB. I think something like the farmer's market, which is relatively close to campus and accessible, in terms of both public transportation and financial assistance, is a good idea for many to consider. 
<br><br>
I also agree that it is not too difficult to lower my carbon footprint. A lot of the things that lower carbon footprint align with my own views anyway. I do not consume animal products because I think it is unfair to the animals, do not buy new clothing because most of it is massed produced in sweatshops, plan to share living spaces to reduce expenses, and plan to adopt children because I want to provide a home for people without one. So, the fact that these are better for the environment is just another positive.
<br><Hr>
It's very interesting juxtaposing our generation's reaction to Ken's steps versus the boomer generation's reaction to his steps. I truly believe that we can change the world through how we choose to live.  I love how you brought so much optimism to the comment section by giving great ideas on how to further live a more eco friendly life! Through things like eating locally grown, vegan food and embracing minimalism, we have incredible power!
<br><br>

It's crazy to realize how the past generation knew that there would be  environmental problems in the future, yet did nothing. However, it's also easy to understand how because they weren't experiencing the direct impact of climate change yet, it was easy for them to look the other direction by continuing to live unconsciously. I think that it's important that we show compassion towards past generations and move forward by doing what they did not.
<br><Hr>
SEEING THIS COMMENT MADE ME SMILE! Honestly, it was so great to see this thread as the top comment on this video because it is really informative on how you as an individual can begin reducing your footprint on our beautiful world. This is the attitude we must have, one of hope and encouragement. By doing this I really feel change can begin in the grassroots. You have given me some new ideas to implement into my life and Im excited to feel like Im doing what I can. If everyone just did their part, we would largely dent this issue. You bring up many pertinent issues and solutions I think are valuable. 
<br><br>

Personally I feel second hand shopping is really good method because it not only rejects the cycle of capitalism but also, typically you can find really cool stuff thats better than stuff from cheap chain stores anyway. Fast fashion is a horrific industry and I hope to see more people standing up these incredibly damaging institutions.
<br><Hr>
This is a great comment. It really shows how easy it could be to change little things in your everyday life and make a big difference. I feel like those of us living in Isla Vista can be proud that we are making a difference without even realizing it too. 
<br><br>

A lot of these things just go for my housemates and I but I feel as though they might be pretty standard things throughout Isla Vista
<br><br>

Eating: We rarely eat meat as a household. it is very expensive and most of the time just make large batches of pasta or cooked veggies. when we do eat meat it is never beef(because of the price) but more often chicken. 
<br><br>

Transportation: Biking is everything in IV. Everyone bikes there's really nowhere to drive unless you're going downtown and you can easily take the bus. 
<br><br>

Housing: IV is so small that everyone is living in these tiny houses with 20 people crammed in them so we're definitely not wanting resources 
<br><br>

Reusing: The majority of us are broke college students, we don't have the means to go buy fancy new clothes so the majority of what I wear is thrifted borrowed, or bought years ago.
<br><Hr>
I totally agree with the suggestions that you put out there. I also think it’s great that many of these things have become “trendy,” so to speak: vegan diets and thrift shopping are almost undoubtedly seen as “cool” things to adopt now. Though some argue that these things should be done as a form of activism and not as a trend, I think it’s great that these things are becoming mainstream because even if people aren’t making these changes for environmental reasons, they’re still making the changes and that’s what matters. Although I never thought I’d see the day when a water bottle was trendy, if Hydroflasks and metal straws are becoming the norm I think that’s overwhelmingly positive.
<br><br>


There also seems to be a misconception that only wealthy people can afford to be environmentally conscious, but that’s simply not the case. Biking and taking public transportation are both far cheaper than owning a car, and living with roommates is cheaper than living alone. I also like that you pointed out that the Farmer’s Market takes EBT; I didn’t know that but I’m glad I do now, and I’m glad that they’re working to make eating local more accessible.
<br><Hr>
Thanks for the tips, they are really helpful. Here are some tips I think we should also use:
<br><br>

Ditch the metal straws y'all: To produce these straws you use natural metals- essentially people need mine for metal ores right?  (It's just like minecraft stay with me here) Metal straws are steel meaning they are made up of iron and carbon plus other elements like nickle, which means companies are taking out big chunks of land for mining sites in order to you guessed it mine to produce these straws. (Which is also stripping places of land and causing pollution). Well that's just another way to strip the earth of natural resources. Metal straws can also rust rendering them useless and prompting you to dispose of them unless you're trying to catch Tetanus. They also take years to decompose because the different metals in the straws decompose at different rates (one of the longer ones being aluminum taking 200-500 years). So I suggest drinking straight out of the cup but for others with disabilities a bamboo straw is a good alternative, it's 100% compostable.

<br><br>

Expiration dates:
<br><br>
Not all food goes bad after the dates. Expiration date dictate shelf life on a store but you can still eat some foods, especially canned.

<br><br>

Waste:
<br><br>
Be conscious about how you dispose of your waste. You can recycle a lot of it. Especially electronical waste, there are places where you can take E-Waste. https://recycling.as.ucsb.edu/techno-recycling/campus-resources-e/ 

<br><br>


Opinion on the video:
<br><br>

The fact that as early as the 1970s people were already aware and feared about the effects of fossil fuels and producing meat-which is about 50 years ago-only adds to the anger against older generations who did nothing. Scientists, policy makers, and the president were alerted about the climate change caused by the increase CO2-seriously?  What was not clicking? As stated above many many were aware and scared and I get that but they could have still tried other ways to rally more attention and grow a movement. I understand that the effects of climate change take a long time to see which you'd think would let people off the hook for not knowing what their actions caused. But Ken, literally just said people had a 1970's Energy Crisis. You'd think this would raise the attention.
<br><Hr>
Everyone should strive to follow these. If you're not able to follow all of them, following the ones that you are able to can make a difference. Another thing about growing your own food is that you can often grow produce that tastes much better than in grocery stores. In my personal experience, my family has grown tomatoes in our backyard and they have much more flavor and everything compared to a store bought tomato. I think what would prevent people from trying to do these things is that they have lived their entire lives one way and having people tell them that this way is a better way to live makes them think that you're attacking their way of life. We see examples of this regarding electric cars. Although not perfect, they still have benefit compared to a fossil fuel powered car. I don't remember Teslas being marketed as the correct car to drive yet there are people who park their gasoline and diesel cars into electric car spaces on purpose just to spite the owners for owning something different than they have. It's hard to change people who have lived their life a certain way until they have first hand experience of the consequences but for the people that are willing to make a difference, it's nice to know that there are so many things that we can do to fight against climate change.

People need to want to change for change to happen. If change is so easy, why don’t we do it? People are selfish and lazy. Everyone has an impact on the environment. I find it important to find ways to lessen my impact by biking, carpooling, shopping locally, thrifting, etc. I wish I could have more of an impact on big businesses such as oil companies and animal agriculture, though. They are truly evil. I like to think that eating vegan makes a huge difference, but I know that a lot more needs to be done. I like the fact that going green by eating vegan and thrifting are in style. It’s important for the masses to stick together and make these positive changes. There shouldn’t be a political divide when it comes to environmentalism, either. Begin green does not block “the American way” of life in any way. We should all stick together and encourage one another to do better.

The fact that the boomer generation knew that meat consumption was a precedent for natural disaster and did nothing to stop this really disappoints me. I feel like currently, our meat consumption as a country is at an all time high. And that is simply because places like Mcdonalds sell burgers for a dollar or two whereas if we wanted to eat healthy, we would have to pay more for the vegetables and healthier food options. It is a sad but evident truth that the processed foods are more encouraged in our capitalistic society and the healthier options are not as advertised. Everything nowadays has added GMO's and other things that are at a need for concern. It is completely true that we should live out this concept of environmental vegetarianism, like Ken mentioned, because of the harm that meat does to the climate. "Earth would sustainably fit a million human beings if we lived a sustainable diet". We should work to eat and live more sustainably so that it would not only benefit ourselves, but our environment as well. I too have been trying to make changes in my diet to eat as less meat as possible, a huge change from my diet before which incorporated going to KBBQ places and other all you can eat meat places to primarily eat meat. My viewpoint on these things has since changed since watching these videos and becoming more knowledgeable about these facts.

I am angered by the lack of activism toward the climate crisis once the signs came into effect and were evident. With the discovery of new negative phenomena, there is often the intent to find solutions to alleviate and reverse their disastrous outcomes. I do agree with the principle of knowledge being “power squandered” not being acted upon. Numerous scientists have found that many of our daily activities contribute to the excess of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, however the general audience during the Boomer generation was only minimally shaken. The overall demand for materials and resources outweighed the contemplation for greener solutions, a trend that was, and still is, sending us to our downfall. I will say that our ignorance as a species has contributed to the formation of a modern culture rampant with excess want and breaches in ethical practices. Luckily, many are starting to change some aspects of their lifestyles in an attempt to minimize contributions to the devastation that results from climate change. It is a shame to look back through time and find that preventative measures could have been taken much earlier, but what matters is the pace at which we attack the issue head on. Who knows if there are more factors to be discovered that contribute to the crisis? At least in taking these progressive steps, we can find and suppress them along with all other disastrous extremes.

I had many thoughts while watching the video “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do”.  I  really enjoy how Ken used these ideas of lifestyle changes in which our generation can actually benefit from.  They may be beneficial but I am thinking that people will not be so thrilled about changing their everyday life in such a significant manner. I feel as if many people agree to this sort of life but are in any way hypocrites because they wont do it themselves. Also with the fact that  people that will enact are the ones where the least populated cities and or states are. So if you are not  affected you wont bother changing your life. I feel like students across the world are making decisions in which are green. Alongside the fact that even IV has many sustainable styles throughout this small city. Compost bins , bike paths, water stations. May sound bad but even the trend of getting a hydrorflask can help in such a way of not wasting plastic. We just need to realize what is best for us in the long run.

I feel angry that people had already noticed the climate crisis coming, but they didn’t act on it. It was their inaction that led to today’s urgent situation.
<br><br>
As early as 1970s, people knew the problem of using fossil fuels, and US had experienced peak oil and energy crisis. In response to it, President Jimmy Carter even put solar panels on the White House for reducing the use of fossil fuels and transforming it to renewable energy sources. Beside, in a popular book Diet for a Small Planet published in 1971, the concept of “environmental vegetarianism” has already existed due to meat’s harm to the environment. Therefore, public back to early 1970s may have no idea about climate crisis, but they knew that they should get rid of relying on fossil fuels and meat as soon as possible.
<br><br>
Yet, people didn’t act on their knowledge. Knowledge can only become power if people act on it. In this case, knowledge is just knowledge. We have already missed our chance once, so we can’t miss it again. For human beings, our planet, and other species, we need to act on our knowledge now.

In this week's presentation, Ken introduces his solution to reducing his personal footprint. It's very simple! They can do this without much effort and are certainly more attractive than their competitors. Also, when Ken talks about how older generations react negatively to these same solutions, I realize that I often see the same reaction in older members of my family. However, I really enjoyed Ken's video on what we could do, because it solved a really tough problem and made it really easy to deal with. I think the two things that most people are most opposed to are giving up cars and meat and dairy products. The second video is more depressing. Knowing that so many powerful people know what they are doing and continue to do it for their own good makes dealing with this crisis all the more frustrating. However, we cannot rest on it. It is, and all we can do is make appropriate sacrifices and change our way of life to offset the problem. What cannot continue is to allow tycoons and skeptics to continue on their current path. Their skepticism has done enough harm that they need to face up to the problem they created and do what they can to solve it. They have been at large for a long time, the least they can do is not to make the problem worse and attack those who are trying to clean up their mess.

For the boomer generation, they are the main group who begin to release carbon dioxide. And some scientists has began to realize the effects of the emission of carbon dioxide. Although, America has reduced the extraction of fossil fuel, they begin to import from middle east. It is no difference. Climate change still is targeted by burning fossil fuels. Nowadays, we can accept the knowledge from the university about climate change. It have big difference in the 1970s. We can gain the information about climate change. So we may can do the correct responses to the global warming.

I was surprised to hear that in the 70s there was a spark in environmental vegetarianism. I had believed that this was a pretty newfound concept and only in the last ten years have I heard people switching to plant-based diets to decrease their carbon footprint. Now, knowing that this idea has been around since the 70s, I am hurt that it is as small of a movement as it is today. I am definitely happy that it is growing now, but since it has been around for so long, you would think that it would be much larger and could potentially be a social norm in this day and age. The truth however is that it is still a minority of people doing this very beneficial act for our environment. I know we blame the older generation a lot in this class, but I think that it is really upsetting that they did not instill this environmental vegetarianism in us since childhood.

<p>

I had the same reaction to the list as the one that Ken described. I thought there was no way that those were the five main things that I could do to decrease my carbon footprint. When reviewing my lifestyle, I already did a lot of the things that he recommended changing without knowing that they would have that sort of effect on the planet. When I first realized this, it lessened my anxiety about the climate crisis. Alone, I do not make a very large impact on the environment, but if a large number of people did, say, everyone in Campbell Hall for this lecture, followed these five things, what a large impact we would have. We may even cause a chain reaction among more students at UCSB and, eventually, all of Santa Barbara. We say we are the leaders of the climate change revolution, so I think we should start acting like it. 
<br><br>
I remember telling my mom that Ken apologized on behalf of his generation for not taking the warnings seriously and she was confused by why he felt the need to do that. I explained to her that people were warned against consuming a lot of meat and advised against releasing carbon into the atmosphere that they had been back then. Of course, this is an example of what Ken said about most of the public not really knowing about the repercussions of the actions that were taken. Policy makers and others in power did not do much to stop these inevitable catastrophes. They did not even fully inform the public about what could happen if they did not take precautions. It makes me angry thinking about how all of this could have been stopped a lot earlier and we would not be in this situation currently.

Ken's video gives me a great sense of why the bomb of CO2 happened and how can it be addressed now. In Ken's generation, people have no or less caution about the bomb of green house gases such as the overuse of oil, the overgrazing of the cows, and so on. I do not think it is anybody's fault to do that without learning about the consequences, and countries's developments need sacrifices. However, I do think it is a complicated problem today because we are actually unable to abandon something such as meat and cars. However, if everybody wanted them, it will be impossible to address the problem. ken also mentions " knowledge" at last in the video. It is  a good use of knowledge to use it as a propaganda in a bus, but I believe the greater problem is how can we actually control people's desire of doing something not that necessary but will have a bad trend to the whole environment.

Business is related to the future of maybe a million of lives. That might be the reason that companies such as Exxon continued to fight against the climate crisis. (Though I more believe in the reason that it is the disadvantage of Capitalistic) This explanation leads me to think that why for so many years there is barely no change in these companies. Rome does not build overnight, but there should be some improvement with bricks to build Roman houses. Actually, the energy is in so much demand that cutting off or decreasing the amount is not possibly plausible. So I think the invention of more, newer, and more efficient energy would be more important than banning fossil fuel.

Learning that people for decades knew what they were doing to the planet is alarming because there’s been a sense of urgency for so long regarding climate change and nothing has been done. As Ken mentioned the knowledge was squandered and rendered useless because it never manifested itself into power. A lack of power leads to a lack of action and sometimes action can be as simple as changing the way you eat. It’s remarkable that we can sustain billions of people with a largely plant based diet but millions around the world to this day continue to deal with food insecurity which will only accelerate with the consequences of climate change.

I agree with your comment here and I think that it is an important point in calling the suggested approaches to climate change as "simple". I think that there are many ways to combat climate change but it is crucial that we act on the one with the most immediate effects. We do not have the luxury of waiting around for the next generations to do what our parents and grandparents should have been doing, so we should at the very least make up for their lack of action, and then some. Ken address climate change activism as uncomplicated as taken the bus instead of your v8 or switching to largely plant based diet. I used to associated activism with the types of radical protests depicted on TV like the school walkouts and what not. But by changing the prejudices deeply rooted in environmentally conscious decisions, we can spark a progressive attitude towards activism supported with the knowledge of what is right for this planet. I feel as though a common perception of vegans and vegetarians is that they are weak or soft, but what if super bowl quarterbacks or NBA star athletes ate and supported a largely plant based diet. The dialogue would switch for youngs kids across the U.S. and even the world to eat more vegetables.

It’s frustrating and disappointing to hear it was known for over 50 years that this issue was going to be brought about if changes weren’t made to our daily lifestyles, yet we continued on with our ways. Previous generations understood what their civil duty was in preventing this issue from getting out of hand yet failed to act upon it because it wasn’t personally affecting them at the time. It is a very well known fact that increasing levels of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are pushing factors for the rapid increase in climate change. As stated in a previous video, the United States has one of the largest outputs for greenhouse gas emissions in the world. In addition to that information we were given five ways we can reduce our carbon footprint with one of them being a change in diet to a more plant based diet. Sadly, I don’t believe we will be able to change our eating habits as a nation. Americans love their meat. We’ve created an obesogenic environment and I can’t foresee anyone who will be willing to reduce their meat consumption, even if it is to save their futures. 
<br><br>

Another main point brought up was Knowledge is Power. I agree with what Ken had to say on this, knowledge isn’t power if it isn’t acted upon. For many years now, people have had the knowledge that we have the power to cause a catastrophy if we don’t act soon enough and change but still nothing was done.




</p><hr>

<p>
Before watching the previous video, I was pretty hopeless that we would be able to cut emissions down enough to where catastrophic events wouldn't happen, but after hearing the almost easy changes we can each make in our lives, it doesn't seem like such a dire future. I know many people who try to lead a very conscious diet, shop at second-hand stores, etc, some have even chosen to do so because of this class. It may not seem like much, but if the majority of populations were to implement these changes into their lifestyle it would be a hell of a change. Considering the output of greenhouse gases from the meat, clothing and transit industry, we have the potential to have a significant impact in lowering our global emissions. 

<br><br>

And I agree with what Ken said about "If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered." because every day we have the power to make a difference in our lifestyle choices, something many people may overlook. Living sustainably using the knowledge we have is our power to be able to make a difference in the climate crisis.

Both of this week's lectures illuminate a lot about how the problem grew over time. The effects of using fossil fuels was known for a long time before action was taken to cut back. Without acting on what we know there is now way to make progress. The climate changing was a worry 50 years ago but there as never enough momentum totally dislodge fossil fuels. I think it is very important for this crisis to stay in the present and not focus on what past generations might have done wrong. It is going to take coordinated individual and governmental measures to begin significant action to try to stabilize the climate. I think making individual changes is very important and this is something that past generations were generally more opposed too. Its still very important to educate because everyone can vote. Alongside individual and social changes there needs to be political support as well.

Ken pointed out the differences between generational responses to his advice on how one can adjust their lifestyle in-order to help the environment and fight the current climate crisis. Transportation(shifting from cars to mass transportation and bicycles), housing(residing in small apartments and communal housing),  wastless food(consuming less meat), having one child per person, and rethinking our relationship with materialist items(buy less and keep what we have longer.) Before Ken discussed the generational responses, I could only imagine how much they would vary because it goes against what many individuals have grown to believe is an enjoyable live. The current generation is swayed by progressive nothins plagued through social media, on campus, and advertised nearly everywhere. More people adopt vegan and vegetarian lifestyles and are open to simplify their life through minimalism. Older generations have molded society into what it is today, with some being proud of the conditions that are now considered “normal.” When Ken mentioned the importance of embracing the ability to change, I realized that this is something that we rarely do as a collective. We discuss the current consequences of climate change, catastrophic potential, and also how we can partake in the change. But there is little discussion about where our lifestyle changes and newly developed habits will take us. It’s as if we know what to do but there is still uncertainty surrounding if we will accomplish our goals. 
<br><br>

In Ken’s second lecture video, he touched upon his generation’s knowledge about the climate crisis. The shift towards the development of renewable energy sources and cutting fossil fuels was prevalent during this time and so was an increase in environmental veganism and vegetarianism. Many were aware of the potential hazards of climate change and the ways that these hazards may be mitigated. I feel that this is highly due to the lack of visible indicators of the hazards. Today, we see the detriments widespread, even though this is only the beginning of the aftermath. This is why Ken’s statement, “Knowledge is  power only when acted upon” is prevalent today and should be taken seriously by the current lives on this planet. I don’t follow any environmental activists or scientists on social media yet I see and read articles and headlines discussing climate change every single day. I hear it discussed in classrooms, radio stations, and in political debates. We, along with the previous generation, have the knowledge now. It is now time to put that power into action and collective work to educate and encourage others to do the same.



</p><hr>

<p>

I wholeheartedly agree with Ken's reinterpretation and revision of the common saying, "Knowledge is power." Indeed, "If acted upon, knowledge is power." Cautionary clauses add a degree of complexity to a saying like this, but one that is entirely necessary to stress the fact that knowledge can only prove useful when implemented in tangible ways. I believe there is a fair amount of people that fall into the category of believing in anthropogenic climate change and the scientific evidence backing it, but not acting upon this alarming information, and this can be attributed to a number of reasons. A few that I can think of off the top of my head are the sacrifices one would have to make in order to curb our footprint, as Ken notes is a very common issue amongst his generation, feeling that their own personal contribution to reducing the debilitating effects of climate change on our planet simply won't be enough to matter, or that one simply can't be bothered to care because they have never been affected by the very much current consequences of climate change. I myself belonged to the second group for the longest time, but I now realize how pessimistic that viewpoint really is, and cynicism towards the grassroots climate change movement proves to be counterproductive and very much against my present morals and beliefs that have evolved over time. I can only hope that my generation will be able to step up to the plate and ACT upon the environmental and humanitarian injustices we are witnessing firsthand due to the inability of previous generations to act upon much of the same knowledge we possess today regarding this global crisis.

The prescribed fossil fuel lifestyles we’ve been living the past century have been the cause of Earth’s climate demise. Besides the clear evidence of fossil fuels impact when burned we’ve continued to increase our CO2 outputs even w/ warning from scientists of potential consequences. The previous generations have supported vicious misinformation campaigns against climate change that have found us where we are today questioning & denying  facts to justify continuing our simplistic fossil fuel established lifestyles. Professor Hiltner informed us of how the government knew about climate change in the 60’s & effort had begun to prepare for the future but time & time again as a nation we’ve let the fossil fuel industry pick what’s best for us. While I too am guilty of abusing fossil fuels it is evident we exercise little control over our fossil fuel use & recently I learned that they’ve opened new oil mines in California next to forests & nature destinations. If we hadn’t been told blatantly enough the time to switch to renewables is now not even seconds from now bc like the Presidents before us if we wait to switch we’ll find ourselves continuing our unsustainable lifestyles. Every oil & coal mine newly established is precious time & resources that could have gone towards renewables which may be less efficient but provide the similar power as these mines but significantly reduce emissions. If countries like Costa Rica can rely 98% on renewables it is embarrassing we rely on anything less than this bc we are a foreground country for technology & research. As a country we’ve run out of excuses for our lack of progress & choose to deny climate change is happening but it’s time to hold ourselves accountable & make the changes to ensure our continuation as successful country and planet.

After hearing Ken’s 5 steps to reducing our carbon footprint, I felt that this was somewhat reasonable. Even doing some of these steps can have an effect on the climate crisis. If everyone in the world were to just do one step, we could have a significant and positive impact on the problem that we have right now. The most reasonable one was possibly using different methods of transportation such as biking and walking instead of solely relying on your car to get places. Just taking one small step can lead to bigger ones and this can lead to positive changes in our living. This not only benefits the health of the earth, but also our health. Doing these things positively help us. What really stood out to me was the difference in responses between generations as our generation would generally be more accepting of committing to this plan of action while those of the older generation tend to be more “selfish”. This indicates that those in older generations are possibly more self centered and are more concerned with their wellbeing. I believe that it is possible to change, however, and that if we all just think more about what we should do instead of thinking about what we could do. In doing so, it could start a stronger movement towards protecting our earth and allow us to live better lives.

After watching this lecture video I have once again been put in a bad mood before bed. As Professor Ken states in the video since the 1970s Americans feared that if they didn’t quickly wean dependence on fossil fuels then it would lead to a collapse of civilization. I mean it’s just horrible because we knew all the way back in 1854 with the work of Eunice Foot and were reminded by Gilbert Plas in 1956.  President Lyndon Johnson made a speech addressing Congress on the alarming rise of CO2, but even then the problem was just brushed aside. Following that, the country experienced a climate crisis showing the reality of what fossil fuel dependence does and we still chose not to act. Seeing the reality of the knowledge we had on climate change and the inaction we chose really just makes me feel like America is a failure. At that time we knew we needed to make a change, but we still took no action. I can’t help but feel hopeless because I look around and see little change. As time goes on, the effect of all the CO2 in the atmosphere becomes more evident and it’s like people’s opinion is oh well. It is horrifying because it makes it hard for me to picture a future and think of any plan of action that will cause the change needed. This video really made me realize that knowledge isn’t power, knowledge is useless without action.

This lecture does a great job in explaining how the costs of our fossil fuel dependent lifestyles were appearing even in the 1970s. The fact that is 2020 and that we are still not fully agreeing on how to reduce our impact on the environment is very concerning. This highlights the need for more education on the subject. Although as the professor said: knowledge is not power, having enough informed voters is the only real way of tackling the issue. It's become very clear from the failure of the generation before us to act that that we cannot rely on everyone doing the right thing and instead that we  need policies that will force us to reduce our emissions. These policies do not to be inherently bad for the economy, we can focus on further incentivizing renewable energy innovation and placing stricter regulations on emissions. A great policy that was driven by smart decision making was electric vehicle tax credits. Drivers would get around 7k reimbursed after buying an electric vehicle. Although this could seem like a waste of tax payer money, this incentivizes the customer into buying the electric car as the price will be lower while also helping grow the company who sold the car who in turn pays more taxes with the increased revenue. Smart policies like these have higher chances of being implemented when there is a pressure from the voter base on politicians to address climate change.

This weeks lectures stated ways in which one can reduce their carbon footprint, and focused on immediate methods. Several of the methods I myself practice and try to get others to practice as well, as they are beneficial and can be done as partial adjustments, rather than extreme life transformations. For many of the changes, there is very little actually cost to individuals, or can save them money. Although each change is a large lifestyle change, they are simple to do and can cause massive differences. The lifestyle is alluring and minimalistic, but is not a lesser life because of that. I find it saddening that the older generation is so materialistic and cares so little about the future generations. I find great disappointment that the older generation believes that the only way worth can be measured is by how large you cars, houses or bank account is, and not how happy you make others and yourself.
 <br><br>
I hope that my generation will keep its values and pass them on to others, but I fear they may eventually grow away from it and become more materialistic. I believe being open change is the most important factor of a generations success or failure, and unfortunately the prior generations were not open. This is demonstrated by that generations extended knowledge of the effect they were having on the environment, and lack of action, backed by the effects caused by cigarettes and their lack of action, or their knowledge of the problem of meat consumption, and their unwillingness to change. The older generations preach equality, and free markets and free trade or open trade, yet they will not change to allow those for a future generation. The past is hypocritical, the future probably will be too.

I was fourteen when I stood on a street corner in Porter Ranch, protesting the SoCalGas well blowout with my family, Save Porter Ranch, and Alexandra Nagy of Food and Water Watch.  I had been to many South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) hearings and a couple of protests before, but this time it was different: because Nagy handed me a microphone to talk in front of all the protestors. But this was not about me, it was about our community, our pain, the loss of our homes, the loss of our innocence.  The heat on the asphalt of the corner we were standing on reminded me of our biggest protest to Los Angeles City Hall, where we all acted as one movement, one voice. 
 <br><br>
 In each of these instances I had only been one protestor in out of many. But by having these experiences I learned something very valuable to me that affects me every day: even just one person can make a difference. I was small, but I was a part of something bigger, which fueled me onward (no pun intended) to make as big of a difference I could make. This knowledge is what we need to become in order to make a true difference in the speedy conquest climate change has over our Earth, as Ken said, "knowledge is only knowledge if it is acted upon".  
 <br><br>
         But in order to become one voice, each of our voices has to ring out loud and clear.  Like Ken describes, the tiny things compile up to be the most impactful in the long run.  Just small changes to diet, lifestyle in terms of transportation, and living smaller (metaphorically as in less waste but also living in smaller areas) are a step in the right direction.  The best thing about this is that it is not that difficult to accomplish if work is put into making a change.  I believe we all can do it, if not because we want to, because we have to for future generations.

<p>
I think that what Ken said about the relationship between knowledge and power is correct and that the boomer generation had a lot of information available to them that they should have used to try to fight the climate crisis earlier. Yet, I wonder how this example can be applied to the current generation. While individuals can try to take steps to fight climate change themselves, it is hard to see how that could have a significant effect. I have switched to a largely plant-based diet since taking this class, yet when I mentioned it to my sister she asked what difference does it make in a dining common where they probably just throw out excess meat that does not get eaten? When Ken mentioned how gas prices drastically increased and how people knew that their reliance on gas was harmful, my first thought was what could individuals have done to stop reliance on gas themselves? In the society we have in America, many are reliant on cars to get to work or run errands and even when gas prices soared, people still needed to buy it. It seems as though effective change must be implemented at higher levels, such as the people in charge of the massive disinformation campaign surrounding climate change being punished or politicians passing a carbon tax law. I felt extremely discouraged listening to Ken describe the failures of his generation because I do not see any significant change in attitude with my generation. It is even possible that fewer people believe in climate change now. It saddens me that I do not know if my generation will be able to learn from the ones that came before it.

In the lecture, the professor introduced the two major gases that made up the greenhouse gases, which are carbon dioxide and methane. The carbon dioxide is released during the burning of fossil fuels, and methane is released by the beef industry. Actually people in the past had the idea that if we did not stop using fossil fuels, society and civilization would collapse in 21 century.  Those greenhouse gases cause the rise of temperature and global warming. The professor suggested that the past generation is actually aware of the environmental crisis caused by them, but they pay too little respect to the climate change and did nothing to stop it from developing so quickly.  
 <br><br>

It is very surprising for me to know that people in the 1970s already have the idea of environmental crisis and the negative side of human activities to the environment. However, it makes me feel sad that our generation is kind of in the same situation right now that people are aware of the climate issues, but they do not put enough effort to make a change. I still remember in the first class, the professor talks about the importance to slow down the increasing of population. And the first step to do it is to educate more women, because women with higher education tend to have less kids. I totally agree with this point that if women get more education, all the people will get benefits that the increasing of population will slow down and women can have equality with men.

"If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered." This quote holds very true, to every last word. It reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from A Bronx Tale, and it goes "There's nothing worse than wasted talent", but in this case we speak of knowledge. And one of the primary ideas of our generation is this idea of climate change, it has been presents for decades upon decades, yet we still sit here and almost nothing about it. This so-called knowledge that we supposedly possess means little to nothing if we're not utilizing it for the betterment of our planet and ourselves. This quote, truly shows how you can have all the intelligence and evidence in the word, but if you still there in silence without acting, it's basically meaningless, so now here we, simply sitting ducks on top of a ticking time bomb. There's so many ways to help put an end to this global devastation and it all starts with us, because we are the future of this world. We can all change our diets, making a primarily vegetable diet, will help reduce cattle emissions, we can move to smaller homes, we can drive less, we can recycle more, we can do so many things to help this current crisis. It all begins with us. We need to act now.

This video made a lot of good points and cleared the misunderstanding that the previous generation was purely unaware of the consequences of their lifestyles and the impending catastrophe it would cause. However, I feel like in human nature, we are unwilling to act upon things that do not directly affect us, even if we know it is bad. Everyone in their lives had other problems that are more pressing than the worry of needing to change their lifestyle for the better of the Earth (as bad as it sounds.) Although I know the changes needed are not that drastic (different transportation, eating less red meat, etc), most people were more concerned with making a living to support their family, along with other urgent issues they had to deal with, and reading the news about climate change once would most likely not cause that much alarm. I am not saying this is necessarily right, but sometimes it just happens like that. Hopefully though, now that this generation truly knows the pressing need for change, we will be able to implement these lifestyle changes in our life and use our voices to call out who is responsible for the majority of climate change. This generation is equipped with all the knowledge, now it is our time to act upon it.

Human beings have put forward theories on climate change in the last century, but until now this problem has not been solved in any way. This worries me and makes me think about what we can do. Since we cannot change the minds of politicians and large companies, we start with the little things in life. We can drive less and take more public transportation; we can try not to waste food; we can also use plastic bags when we buy things (some stores require you to pay extra dollars to buy plastic bags, which is good. Knowing that when I was studying in Pennsylvania, I found that the plastic bags in the stores there were free. This would allow people to use plastic bags without restrictions.)

<p>
In the lectures Prof. Hiltner taught, we are told that there are five ways that we can do to reduce carbon emissions. They are 1) change transportation tool, 2)reduce food waste, 3)move to a city, 4)reduce population, 5)buy less. Somebody may wonder: Is that it? By doing this, all of the carbon emission and the ozone holes can be minimized? Well, one person certainly cannot achieve that, while the effort of us, the human beings, is going to be huge. However, there should be some advertisements on social media or on billboards to encourage people as they tend not to take certain action if their interest is harmed. For example, in Santa Barbara, people will not simply reduce car use to minimize carbon emissions. In order to achieve that, we can emphasize the possible effect of climate change to future generation, their grandchildren. 
 <br><br>
In my own opinion, blaming this for past generation is simply useless as it does nothing for our children. Whether they have realized the sea level is rising or not is simply not helping us. What matters to us and future generation is do our job to reduce carbon emissions.

I already don't own a car, but not eating meat is not going to be so easy. I will be the first to admit while I could eat less meat, it would be difficult to give it up all together. As far as houses and family sizes go, I think it becomes difficult to argue that people should have any more than two children as our planet's resources are already being stretched so thin and that any family of four needs a house as big as the new American average of 2,500ft+. I would certainly argue for more sustainable/renewable energy and public transportation, as our pollution levels are only exponentially increasing as more and more people inhabit the planet. I fear that people are so ignorant and blinded to the climate change issue generationally, as older generations influence younger ones to inaction as they believe it is not as big of a deal as it really is. "Knowledge is power , if not acted upon knowledge is squandered,"  was a profound quote by Professor Hiltner. We have known about the issues and consequences of climate change for decades now, and we are still ignoring it! This course is an incredible step towards educating our current generation to fight climate change.

As the popularity of social media rises so too does people's envy and greed. People are always trying to find the next way to get clout and part of that involves buying expensive things that others do not have just to show off and prove their worth. This is causing people to stop caring about the planet because if someone were to get rich and famous then that fame will most likely get to their head and make them go on a shopping spree. This way of life will be our downfall and even if these people know the potential risks that come with things such as flying on private airplanes and owning mansions, their greed will take over. I thank the older generations for teaching us what we can and can't do for sustainability, however this knowledge really is squandered by my generation. Most of the older generations didn't even know that they were causing this problem so why would we blame them? If the roles were reversed and we were in their shoes, we wouldn't know what to do either. We're so scared of change which makes a good number of us not want to act and just ignore what is happening around us. I know for a fact that people will not want to give up their car or nice house or their meat based diet just because others are telling them to. Furthermore I feel that people might think that it is already too late to dramatically change this crisis so they've given up all hope and just hope to go out with a bang even if that means screwing up the lives of others. I know that it is not too late and we as a society should embrace change and require others to learn about this issue and change their ways of life because when another energy crisis emerges, it's going to be chaos.

I genuinely think these specific videos about what we can do and how the older generation has screwed us are very interesting. I enjoy the very valuable suggestions given to reduce our carbon footprint and do try and implement them in my own life daily however I can. Although this is the case, I do find it difficult to act about such ways in the way humans live. That thought is understood and even noted on when Ken talks about the growth of homes over the years and how his generation is proud of the accomplishments they’ve done in their time of work. It’s very difficult to imagine life like such because of the picture our parent’s generation has painted for us to live a “luxurious” life. Living in a big house, with a large family, and driving beautiful cars has always been a huge dream of mine, as that idea has been portrayed to be successful and fulfilling. While I do still carry these ideas and can’t completely diminish these thoughts, I still have different thoughts of how I would live and eat simply from the knowledge obtained over the past few weeks. Crazy to also consider the past when there was a shortage of gasoline and this affected American's lives monumentally. In turn, that’s why I believe electric cars and renewable energy are essential elements for the betterment and prosperity of the Earth.

<p>
After watching the video “What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis – and when we knew it”, I have a better understanding of how I can contribute to the environment and reduce my carbon footprint. There are exactly five aspects that Ken recommends for the public to practice, which will effectively reduce our CO2 footprint to mitigate climate change. To begin, taking public transportation will be a solution for this issue, as people with private cars produce a quarter of their individual CO2 footprint. Moreover, a micro-apartment or co-housing community will also help to reduce carbon footprint. People always tend to choose a big house, but a micro-apartment will be more environmentally friendly. Besides, developing a plant-based diet and preventing wasting food will also help. Furthermore, controlling the number of children is another way worthy considering, which will consume fewer resources of the limited stuff from the planet. Finally, to buy fewer clothes and fast fashion stuff is also effective, since the environment is always severely destroyed during the process of clothing production.



</p><hr>

<p>
I continue to find myself dwelling on the concept of a "delay" that has occurred, and that we've touched upon since the beginning of the quarter. I think what frustrates me the most is that, at least in my experience, it seems like genuine concern for the climate has only now become visibly popular, probably because it can no longer be postponed or neglected. NOT to say that there haven't been activists who have spent their lives raising awareness before this time, there have been. Considering that we knew about these problems since the 1970s, half a century ago, but are only now feeling the general pressure to fix this. The climate crisis has been neglected until capitalism found a way to manage it and monetize it.

"Knowledge is power only if acted upon."
 <br><br>
The information regarding climate change has existed for over a hundred years, yet we find ourselves today scrambling to find a solution for this issue. It seems shocking that it has taken this long for our society to finally address this issue with a serious intent of solving it. When watching this video, I couldn't help myself but ask "Why?" However, from a psychological perspective, human beings do not like interacting with things that can be uncomfortable if there is no easy solution. Furthermore, I believe that the general approach seen in previous decades can be scaled down to a very simple analogy. As a student, I know that there have been times that I was given a deadline and waited until the last minute to finish my assignment. Although I was given plenty of time to work on an assignment, I found that I would often wait until the last minute because of several reasons. First, I was fairly certain that I could get it done in time, and second, I did not want to have to face the stress and work associated with the assignment. I think that everyone relate to a time that they have put off a deadline to avoid dealing with it until the last minute. Unfortunately, this mindset can definitely be applied to the issue of climate change. It is evident that those who did not act to reduce their carbon footprint in previous decades either believed that their impact would not matter or that the later generations would solve the problem. Perhaps some were even hopeful that future innovations would solve the problem. This issue precisely shows the lesson of this quote. Given the knowledge that we have accumulated for decades, we must begin making significant changes before the consequences amount to something that we cannot control.

<p>

I feel like too often in our society the generational gap is used to justify the irresponsible behavior of our elders, and really it is just a frustrating waste of everyone’s time and energy. There are so many people within the older generations that are perfectly willing to help with the climate crisis and have already made steps in doing so, and yet, still, we hear every day that you cannot blame boomers for the way they are because that is just how they were raised. Obviously, if some can change, it is not just a matter of how they were raised. It is a matter of who they are as a person. People can change if they really want to, but these people do not. And sometimes, that just means they’re bad people. I think admitting this to each other and accepting that as a truth may be more of what is necessary than making excuses, because when they have excuses, they will continue to behave as they do. We need to stop accepting these excuses and hold them accountable for their actions, and not let them think that we will not do so. Otherwise, we will continue to see the differences in responses by generation as shown in the video, and nothing will change. As Ken said, knowledge squandered has no power at all, and if we do not want to squander our knowledge, we have to admit that there are many in this world, particularly of older generations, who used their power in terrible ways and unless they can and will help change then they will remain terrible people.

Both of the lectures this week helped me think of ways that I could reduce my own carbon footprint. After watching the lectures, I learned that I am already doing some of the solutions that Ken listed, however I know that I could, and also need to, to more. I also believe that it is more important for us to focus on solving the climate crisis, instead of blaming others for it. 
  <br><br>
       In Ken’s lecture, “What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis - and when we knew it,” he states that knowledge only becomes power when we act upon it. This statement stood out to me the most because I agree with it. You can know about something, but if you do not do anything about it/”act upon it”, then it really has no significance.



</p><hr>

<p>
Climate change was always something people thought about years ago, but never something that was shed enough light on. Through the lecture, we are explained the different ways that climate crisis was brought up, but again, not enough people were having a conversation about it. I truly do not blame the boomer generation, although it should be recognized that they lacked the ability to notices the changes in the world as they were not as noticeable as they are now. I primarily do not blame that generation because, may people do not want to worry about the world ending or not being habitable and honestly, although many investigated climate change, they still lacked resources.
  <br><br>

It took major impacts to get people to believe in it such as the peak oil and Middle Eastern countries to put an embargo on oil to unleash what it had. Pumping oil is not good for the environment for the toxins it releases to the atmosphere but with just this, people notices how much they relied on oil. It does become frustrating that then it still took people a while to take action. But props are still given to those who tried to get the message to the public such as Jimmy Carter by installing solar panels to the White House, despite being taken down later by Reagan.

When I was 10, the world expo was held in Shanghai. One of the most vivid memories I could recall is the exhibition of the environmental issue. After realizing that we have a limited amount of fossil fuel supply, I asked my dad a question: why are we not cutting our use of fossil fuels if we know that they are going to run out 30 years from now. 
  <br><br>

“It’s not as urgent as they claimed.” He replied, “ The statistics are exaggerated by the oil industry in order to get a more favorable price from the customers. There are hidden oil supplies somewhere that we have not reached yet. Even if it does run out, humans are smart enough to find another source of energy to replace that.” I think my dad’s opinion represents a lot of people in his generation. They witnessed the booming of the oil industry, and are certain that, just like all other sources of energy that we have used before, oil is going to be replaced by a better, cleaner fuel and there’s nothing to worry about .
  <br><br>

But little did we think about what we can do if some day in the future, we would have no choice because the earth, once uninhabitable,can’t be replaced.

I appreciated the straightforwardness in “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” regarding actions one can make to reduce our carbon footprint. Living in a city is one of the ways to achieve a decrease in the carbon footprint that initially took me by surprise. In my mind, I had already made the association of cities releasing smog and polluting the air, whereas, if one lived in nature, there was less environmental harm done. However, this is not the case because of factors such as pollution from commuting. In a city, less space is taken up by many people, public transportation is more efficient, and destinations are closer in proximity. Another point that had surprised me was the known environmental detrimental effects of the meat industry. Before this class, the main argument that I had heard of for becoming a vegetarian was the ethical treatment of animals. That being said, I wonder why I had not widely heard of the environmental aspect of the meat industry before this class if it is a known big contributor to climate change. This accentuates the “If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered” statement. It demonstrates that if we do not act upon a known issue, the issue will continue to intensify and it will be ultimately too late to resolve.

I am profoundly impacted by the quote by Ken. It is true. If we don’t apply the knowledge we learned, the knowledge is useless. Only if we act upon the knowledge can the knowledge becomes powerful and meaningful. I didn’t know the plant-based diet would benefit our environment until I watched the documentary about it. Then I decided to convert my food completely. Not only is that healthy, but it also saves us human beings! Also, I’m considering reducing private transportations. Busses, carpools, and bicycles have their advantages in addition to cutting carbon footprint! On Uber, you can get to know different people and idea and even share what you learned about anthropogenic climate change with them. Plus, you don’t need to worry about parking! Busses allow you to do the same thing, and, remember, busses are economical, and we have bus pass! Bicycles need no justification for our health.

I found if very powerful when professor Hiltner stated "“For it to become power, we must act on knowledge." This class has given me alot of information regarding climate change, but acting on the information is what makes it powerful. What is the point of learning about the current devastating climate conditions, but refusing to change my habits? I hope to lower my carbon footprint and implementing the following steps:
  <br><br>
Try to eat as vegetarian as possible. Ideally, I would be a full blown vegan and cut off all animal products. However, taking baby steps is proven to give sustainable and long lasting results. I will start by eating vegetarian once a week, then progress to two, and keep going. I already walk or bike to class, preventing more carbon dioxide emissions from gas fuels. 
  <br><br>
I also want to educate others on our current environmental crisis. A huge reason why climate change is getting worse is because people are not educated on the problems we currently face. Understanding the problems caused by global warming will influence people to make changes.



</p><hr>

<p>
The ways Ken shows us how to reduce our carbon footprint and help save the earth are so SIMPLE yet so much people struggle with the idea that we could save the earth as soon as today. Past generations neglected the earth and its resources and now WE are left to fix it. While I understand we shouldn't blame past generations because it could simply happen again. I hope that we CAN make a C H A N G E but that depends on if every single person living on this world can help.

After watching the two lecture videos, it is astonishing to know that people were aware about the necessity of burning less fossil fuels to reduce the emission of CO2 in 1970s, and the theory was first stated in 1854. As Professor Hiltner said in the video, “knowledge is not power,” and it is a power when we start to use it and act on it. In addition, I get more insight into how the change of personal activities can mitigate the climate crisis, and I will definitely do to change my own lifestyle to an environment-friendly way. Still, I am optimistic about our future since many of our generation are acting on promoting the condition about climate crisis.

I initially thought I had a general idea about when human beings first knew about climate changes, but I was largely wrong. I didn’t know that the issue was discussed in the 19th century and moreover, most Americans did agree at that time that if nothing was done to the lifestyle, consequences will be resulted in in the 21st century. However, they failed to take action because the deadline was not approaching at that time. Actually, what is happening now is exactly like what is happening in the 20th century. We had more and more scientific reports about the scale of climate change, and we even have a general idea about how climate may change according to the rise of the temperature. But, we are still not moving. As said in the video, knowledge is not power, and I totally agree with that. Additionally, I begin to believe the climate deniers nowadays are not without sufficient knowledge, the objections resulted from mainly their own protective mechanism that failed to acknowledge what they already believed in. Therefore, I don’t appreciate any approaches emphasized on spreading out the severity of climate changes. Instead, we climate change advocates must think about how to psychologically appeal to those deniers who could not face the fact that the deadline is approaching. We are like kids who play games the last day even though they know the exam is on the next day. We all think like this, one way or another.

I was surprised about people have realized the catastrophe of using fossil fuel as early as 19th century. And the generation we have been blaming about last week knew that it is urgent to employ renewable and sustainable energy. “If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered.” It is so true that people had the knowledge but instead they did little. While watching this lecture I was constantly asking: "Why did not any one do anything?" Although such question ignores activists such as author of Diet for a Small Planet, majority of Ken's generation did not act upon their knowledge. It is sad. And we need not to blame what has already done but to learn from this and start acting and changing today.

One of the things that really clicked for me in this videos was how dependent we are on fossil fuels when Ken talked about the energy crisis in the 1970s due to a conflict in the Middle eats. In our society we use fossil fuels every day. We use it when we turn on the lights, when we drive our cars, and even depend on it to put our foods on our tables. With fossil fuels being so intrinsic to our daily live I can see why the some are stubborn to switch off fossil fuels. With our politicians bought and those who fear not being respected because they don’t want to intrude in people’s lives, it’s hard to believe anything can be done. Corporations have rotten our government. But something has to be done. We have little time left to switch from fossil fuels to a renewable energy economy. This isn’t something that we can get to eventual with incremental change because we simply don’t have the time. Our dependency on fossil fuels I’m sure has something to do with the fossil fuel industry and their greed but we have to do whatever we can to finally put an end to it. Whether it’s voting, making lifestyle changes like pointed in the video through vegetarianism or transportation changes we can all do something. This isn’t something we can solve by believing that someone else will take care of it. Like the said we must look at the previous generations failures to make sure we don’t make the same mistakes.



</p><hr>

<p>
We have achieved so much as a species and as a result of our prowess, we have developed a deadly addiction to fossil fuels. We used these resources to industrialize, improve our way of life, and capitalize on the economic profitability of this buried treasures. With the unprecedented advancement in industries and technologies over the years we have also benefited on the proliferation of knowledge through the internet. We can’t say that in our journey of destroying the earth slowly we didn’t gain create some ingenious developments. 

  <br><br>

However, now is the time to put that ingenuity to the test. Not against each other, competing for profit, but with each other competing against the inevitability of the consequences of our action. It’s hard to match Ken’s optimism with suggesting us with changing our interactions with five points (transportation, housing, food waste, limited children, and our relationship towards things). We have a small margin of error before we push mother Earth of her limit. We can turn our use our knowledge to individualize ways of contributing for the benefit of our planet.

Going back to the last lecture video about how we can change our ways and improve our environment. I completely agree with all of the excuses that you used but I would like to add another one that I'm guilty of. I'm not proud of it but I think many others can agree. Sometimes I say " If others don't do it, why Should I?"This is a very bad way to think and I think my ways have definitely changed because of my recent knowledge with what is going on. We were raised as children to believe that money is happiness, that the more expensive clothes you have, the "cooler" you are. I believe that propaganda had a major impact with the climate crisis. All different type of companies try to target people and make them believe in what they want them to. Many people are just not satisfied with what they have and always want more and more, overall just killing our planet slowly but surely. We need to not only change our harmful ways, but become aware that we are the rats in the rich peoples experiment. They feed us these crazy ideas and want us to act a certain way.

I remember growing up my mom always raised my family to be very health conscious, to buy organic foods, eat little meat, and focus on a plant based diet. I never understood why she was always checking the labels of food packaging or was so cautious as to bring her own cloth bags everywhere we went, and now I do understand. I feel like this class has really opened my eyes to the dangers the climate crisis has created, and as my mom is a perfect example, it was no mystery to the previous generation. The affect is visible around the world, the use of fossil fuels and gas price is something that's often been discussed not just within my family here, but even when visiting my grandparents who live in Europe. And the price change in gas is just one of the smallest pieces of evidence that can be seen. The worst is truly yet to come.
  <br><br>
I agree in Ken's statement that "knowledge is power if acted upon". The first step to this is having the knowledge, signing up for a climate crisis class, and truly listening. Ken has done a very good job on his end of this, as his devotion to this topic truly shines through with each lecture he creates. The next part is now up to us, as Ken mentioned, his generation is a forewarning for ours, our own fate is now in our hands, as our generation will be alive to see the destruction that will come to this planet if change doesn't occur. We have the knowledge some do not have, so we must get involved in protecting the earth rather tan continue to let it self destruct before our eyes.




</p><hr>

<p>
Ken's quote about knowledge being squandered without action was one that truly stuck out to me because it is the unavoidable truth we must face about climate change. Whether we know about climate change or not, the lack of inaction that results from both sides of the coin ultimately will result in the same consequence of our planet being destroyed. Even if not permanently destroyed, life as we know it as humans will end and that in itself is truly such a tragic way to end a period of progress and prosperity. This class has opened my eyes into seeing that humans are really their own self destruct button, careless to the means that could result in their own ends solely for ulterior gain. Although many individuals do not think that way such as Ken and environmental activists, the fact of the matter is that we have people in power who do not care for us and would rather the world burn to keep money in their pocket, which makes this whole situation that much more devastating and hard to come to terms with. 
  <br><br>

It may be this knowledge that drives people to inaction, leading them to believe that their actions at this point are futile in the face of this power. I know personally that is my standpoint at the current moment. I am terrified about the fate of our children and those to come after them once we pass the tipping point of no return at the actions of these men in charge, and although they anger me I know that they will not even be here when that happens to see what their actions have caused. What a truly disheartening way to go out on a planet that we were supposed to be protecting.




</p><hr>

<p>
You are right. We did know about this issue way in advance. We did know of its potential effects and we did know of what actions we could take to stop it ahead of time. Yet still knowing this information, we continued to release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 
  <br><br>

In my honest opinion, I believe that this truly was an issue of the average American not seeing it as a big issue. Although you mentioned this argument in the lecture and how its effects were still wide published and how it was an issue that the average American was aware was, one thing I feel wasn't addressed was how dire of an issue was to these people. Is the average American who is struggling during the energy crisis to power their house, buy gas to get to work, living paycheck to paycheck trying to support their family really going to care about a potential crisis that has no immediate effects? It is pretentious to look down on those struggling during the economic recession and scold them for not investing in expensive solar panels, forgoing cheap affordable hamburgers from McDonalds, and not taking public transportation in a place that lacks infrastructure for it. This complete lifestyle change is of course now accessible in the half century since the 70s as the expense of solar/renewable technology has drastically become less expensive, there are cheaper/better/more bountiful alternatives to meat such as the impossible burger and lab grown meat, and public transportation infrastructure has seen mass and continuous improvement. From the 1970s to 2000s, switching to green alternatives was simply not and option for middle class/lower middle class Americans if they wanted to survive. This is what I believe is the reasoning for why we went down this path. I just simply can't bring myself for being angry for what the past generation did up until the 2000s. All the actions against preventing climate change after the 2000s I am angry at, because they are now willingly avoiding those alternative options.

I very much enjoyed both lectures this week. Beginning with the one addressing what we can do. Seeing each of these 5 reasons made me genuinely happy and I resonated with a lot of them. Last year, I went vegan for a couple months not for the ethical or moral reasons. But purely to lessen my carbon footprint. I am also really glad that the professor touched up on the generational disconnect occuring when talking about ways to lessen your individual impact on the environment. I also think the way each of the methods was laid out was communicated very well as it is surely possible to see someone have the second reaction to being faced with these actions. One thing I did want to just comment on was how could these same techniques be applied to a community of lower income communities. As the professor stated this course is a small, select group of people but when applying these same rules to a larger scale could prove quite difficult. Really not trying to sound negative but coming from a low income community I'm sure if I were to show the techniques listed it would not be taken seriously as where I come from people are concerned about putting food on the table, not environmentally friendly methods. Did not mean to go on that tangent I just thought it at least be acknowledged that while these practices are great and I personally will be accountable for my carbon footprint I wonder how we could educate the public that is often glanced over (Food deserts, low income communities etc.)
  <br><br>


As for the boomer generation, they have apparently known that our reliance on fossil fuels has been an issue for some time. Apparently dating back as early as the 1800's there was some insight that rising CO2 levels could prove troublesome to our generation. However, due to the rise in American culture and innovation, America continued to really on fossil fuels. A study even predicted America would run out of fossil fuels by the 70's and what do you know? It did. Instead of switching to renewables and slowly decreasing our reliance on oil we instead chose to rely on imported oil. Again, this is where politics play a role as there were a couple of energy crises in the 70s. I was glad to see the professor acknowledge the living situations in a place like China v. US and how the idea of "buy what you want, live how you want" directly contrasts the more sustainable way of living America should shift towards now.

Ken does give alarming and valuable comments in his lecture videos. People learned about the influences of global warming from many years ago, but in recent years people are paying attention and taking action for this issue. If people can take action earlier, the environment now would be really different. With the technology and power that humans have now, it is effective for humans to deal with the problem. We have to make a difference. We cannot change the past, but we can be responsible in the future. 
  <br><br>
Though the climate crisis is caused by people from the parents' generation, they are the young people who will actually make an effort to stop global warming. Recently, I read an article about how climate change will influence child health. At the end of the article, the author says "in this country where people ostensibly pursue justice, it is injustice for the children who did nothing to suffer from this problem." The effort we are going to make for stopping climate change is not only for the better environment but also for the justice this society addressed.

I would’ve never thought that the “awareness” that Professor Hiltner mentions were at the level it was during the 1970s, an era that we have learned and now commonly associated with the generation that has contributed the most to the climate crisis. Even their understanding of the consequences of fossil fuel (CO2) and meat industries (methane) came as a disappointing surprise. The most unnerving part about it is Hiltner's claim that if any random American were stopped during this time they would have known about these issues and would have been considerably worried about them. Couldn’t we say the same about today? Without question, we would get the same response from most Americans on the street today. It all comes down to whether we want to separate ourselves from the generations before us and take action, or follow in their footsteps and let the crisis fly over our heads and fail to wean ourselves off of fossil fuel and meat industries. 
   <br><br>

Additionally, I was very intrigued by Hiltner’s discussion and perception of knowledge. It is so very true, especially in the context of our current environmental and climate crisis, that knowledge coupled with inaction certainly does not become power, it becomes nothing. This recognition goes hand in hand with the 5 steps of “action” that we can take individually to reduce our carbon footprint; moving away from identifying our climate crisis towards what we can actually do about it, which is the part of the course I am most interested in learning about. While all things on the list are equally significant in their potential impact within the climate crisis, I am most intrigued by 4 and 5: population and cultural revolutions. Houses have gotten bigger, coupled with expanded carbon footprints, even though families are getting smaller. Lastly, in regard to the cultural revolution, I believe this will be the most difficult and widespread change that will need to happen for our society to turn in the right direction. For generations, our society has been consumed with the notion of being consumers defined by our materialistic possessions, this is especially true for the American culture/American dream ideal that many of us are so familiar with.

I completely agree with your outlook, especially concerning your thoughts on the “awareness” that Professor Hiltner discussed. It does seem very similar to our feelings today; we know about the issues, just as they did in the past. We are deeply concerned with the issues and what it could mean for our future, just like the past. Yet still, we continue to produce half hearted efforts in order to save the planet we live on. It shocks me that back in the 70’s, pollution was so bad due to transportation and the meat industry that it practically began the climate change. What frustrates me is that we still continue to do the same to a lesser extent and hope for a different outcome. In my opinion, the whole reason we are still in this debacle of a climate crisis is due to our outlook on it. We only make the minimal changes in order to save a minimal future for ourselves on this planet, and continue to make more and more changes as situations get worse on Earth. Instead, we should genuinely care about our planet and make extreme overhaul changes in this moment in order to have a guaranteed place of living for the future. Unfortunately, however, it seems too difficult for the standard human to give up their luxuries and want to help Earth and the human race in the long run before it is too late.

I've always found it interesting and slightly disappointing that people knew about the danger of burning of fossil fuels in the 1960s and 70s, yet industry continued and the problem was cast aside. Although there was some effort made, such as President Carter placing solar panels on the White House, the general population had no clue of the future crisis that would come to be. Yet, like Ken said in the video, "if not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered." I wonder, if people knew the gravity of this issue today back then, would more people actually take action? Or would the naysayers that exist today just come out sooner? It is comforting to know, however, that people back in the 70s wanted to eat less meat and take better care of the planet for the sake of taking care of the planet, not because there was impending doom. I could ponder this all day, but wallowing in the past will not make the problem at hand go away. I appreciated that Ken does not want to cast blame on his generation, but instead wants to use the story as a warning sign for future generations. The only thing that can be done now is to take action into our own hands, and not only make personal changes but enact political change through protesting and challenging Congress. It is not too late to act, but if we don't act fast then the cautionary tale will turn into a story of how our planet was completely destroyed.

I cannot say that I'm not a huge fan of the "ok boomer" trend of no longer taking old peoples bullshit; however I think it is also shooting ourselves in the foot because we need to convince older generations about the harmful effect of pollution  on our planet. While it is frustrating to see the generation that caused climate change denying that it exists, it seems like it would be more helpful to try and help them understand the situation than "ok boomer"ing them. Mainly I think it's important to try and garner their votes because the older generations are one of the largest voting populations their is, and if they became aware of what a dire situation climate change is, them caring is super important. I wish there was a way for the boomers to gently taught how climate change works so that they wont freak out or feel attacked

Ken’s quote, “If acted upon, knowledge is power, if not acted upon knowledge is power squandered” is so true and has such a deep meaning. Knowledge is useless unless the person containing that knowledge puts it to use to better the world. Someone who does not take action, but has a great amount of knowledge and understanding on a subject is virtually useless. Actions always speak louder. Those who go out and take action with the knowledge they have gained are going to be the ones who make a difference in the world. It was really scary to learn that people knew that by the year 2000, the effects of climate change would be catastrophic and just the start of it. Yet, politicians and others still did not take action. A lot of the climate issues have been almost hidden from the public by the big corporations who are only out for one thing... profit. The sad thing is that money is absolutely useless if you are living on a planet that is facing global destruction and horrific events. The average American throughout the decades, despite the new data being gathered on the issue of climate change, did not take action when they could have right away. Simple changes that can be made are the foods we eat, how we use transportation and the number of fossil fuels and carbon we release as an individual. Including the carbon and other greenhouse gases that are released when cars, clothes, and other things are manufactured. Instead, people were selfish and greedy and refused to change their way of life. This goes back to Ken's quote which I talked about above, this new knowledge was, in essence, useless since no one took action. We as a human race are running out of time to stop the drastic changes that are being brought forth by us that are affecting all life every single day. My generation simply cannot afford to make the same mistake as past generations have. If we don’t use the knowledge that has been gathered over the years, we are simply inevitably doomed.

In Ken’s first lecture video, he lists 5 simple ways to reduce a person’s carbon footprint. One of the most staggering statistics he throws out is that 1 pound of beef is equivalent to producing as many greenhouse gases as 30 pounds of lentils. Some of these stats always surprise me no matter how many times I hear them. I agree with Ken in that older generations have a much harsher response to some of these changes. I think older generations are much more stubborn in their ways, and many people get more stubborn as they grow older. They don’t want to change their ways or their habits. Not because they’re bad people, but because much of the older “boomer” generation have grown up in such a way where having a big house and big family were all goals they should work for and have worked for. Like Ken said, his generation advanced Americ the most with the amount of technology and innovation that came through in all of those years, the same technology and innovation that we use today. In his second lecture, Ken talks about when we started to realize that climate change and an increase in CO2 levels could possibly have a negative effect on the Earth. I found it really disturbing when he mentions that Exxon-Mobil knew about the problem since the 1970s. That means that they’ve known about the rise in CO2 levels and climate change for half a century and still continue to pump more and more CO2 into the atmosphere, to make a profit on the ruining of the Earth. I found it very interesting that as a result of the middle east embargo on selling oil to the United States, people were forced to at least start thinking about renewable energy sources. 50 years later and the world is in a worse off state environmentally speaking. In the above mentioned 5 things that can be done to reduce climate change, I feel like some of them have become such a way of life in America as well as tons of other countries across the world, that it would be almost impossible to reduce them by a significant amount. Take cars for instance. Yeah, in Santa Barbara or other small cities like Manhattan, you can bike for the most part and you’d be fine. In fact, I really believe that most of the people I know could probably bike to work but simply choose not to for whatever reason. However, the car culture in the U.S. and countless other countries is so strong, that it would be almost impossible to get Americans out of cars and onto bikes. I think the world would sooner become vegetarian then give up their cars. Nonetheless I was still inspired once again with the ending of Ken’s second video, specifically his phrase, “knowledge isn’t power unless it is acted upon”.

The idea that older generations may have known that we needed to end the use of fossil fuels and that it would inevitably affect our lives is very saddening. It’s difficult to think of how things could have been changed before it got too late, and how my parents and my grandparents could have worked to make a better future for me and the generations after me. One of the quotes from Professor Hiltner that really struck me was ““If acted upon, knowledge is power; if not acted upon knowledge is power squandered”; it made me think about what I can be doing to ensure the planet will be somehow survivable for the generations after me. It’s interesting and horrifying to think about what could have been done before it was too late.

For once, I have been plainly laid out how I can reduce my carbon footprint. I have known the basic ways such as avoiding cars but I did not know about alternate living methods.  I felt guilty knowing that I get a sense of how I need new clothing but in reality it is a small need that can be put aside. Clothes are made to last, or they can be at least if you try to. Hiltner and his phrase about what we can do with knowledge is something that my generation needs to hear. We had the fortune to understand what climate change is but the knowledge was largely not used for the better. Hiltner inspiring us to move forward with our knowledge on climate change can be used on any scale. I want to partake in the 5 steps that Hiltner laid out for us to help reduce our carbon footprint. I have to admit that I have had the thought many times of how if i do something that had a chance of creating more trouble for our planet, but only everyone once in a while, I would be fine. Yet it seems very obvious now that I am not alone in this thinking, because it can add up very fast. I want to make up for those times where I lapsed in judgment thanks to Hiltners alternatives that he has given us.

Both lectures were interesting to watch as I have asked myself the questions of “why did previous generations just ignore the signs” and “what can I do to make a difference?” When Ken said he was going to give us some tips on how to reduce our carbon footprint I thought he was going to say things we didn’t already know about but I still see why the ones he mentioned are important. All of the things he mentioned go hand in hand with each other. For instance the fact that there are 7.7 billion people on this planet is insane. This then leads to wondering how we will feed future generations if the population keeps increasing at this rate. Where will people live if we keep making huge homes? In regards to transportation we have seen how expensive gas has gotten yet this does not stop us from purchasing it. 
  <br><br>
I also found it interesting how Eunice Foote was the first scientist to suggest that an increase in CO2 would lead to an increase in global temperature rise in 1854. I however also found it sad how not many cared about making a change until the 1970’s when there was an oil crisis. This proves that unfortunately a good amount of people are not motivated to make a change unless something affects them directly. President Carter was one to take initiative and installed solar panels on the white house with the purpose of encouraging people to switch to reusable energy. However many years have passed and this has yet to happen 100%. If we had switched to renewable energy when President Carter first installed it in the white house it would have made a significant change. However, we still have a long way to go and need to act soon.

I was amazed at how Ken talked about how people knew that climate changed was occurring for a while, yet it took so long for scientists to start acting on it. I think a problem with our society was a  that lot of people were not informed that this was happening, and as a result continued with their climate change causing actions. Had more people known that this was going on, I think our current state would be a lot different. While many people are to blame for causing this climate change we are experiencing right now, I don't think it is right to blame everyone from the past for not knowingly causing this climate change. The people that are to blame are the ones who knew climate change was happening and chose to do nothing about it.

“For it to become power, we must act on knowledge.” This is a very powerful quote by Professor Hiltner that should be as common as the well known phrase “knowledge is power.” As mentioned in this video, Americans have known and feared the consequences of our everyday actions for decades. Boomers are in large responsible for the state of our planet today, but this new generation will soon have the same effect, if not a larger effect, on our planet if we do not take immediate action. As Professor Hiltner emphasized in this video, simply acquiring knowledge on the causes and effects of our everyday actions is not enough to help save the planet. We must act on this knowledge on both a small and larger scale. In the other video, Professor Hiltner mentioned many different ways one can reduce one’s ecological footprint, whether it’s by walking and/or taking the bus to commute or purchasing a much smaller home than the average American home. We have all been given the knowledge and information needed to help reduce climate change, but it is now up to us to turn that knowledge into power.

You almost says everything what I want to say. Knowledge will become a power when we execute and implement it. If we have the knowledge but still stay inactive, it will be just like we know nothing. Sometimes knowing something but not doing it is a kind of irresponsible action. This is what we are dealing with climate change. Just like Ken mentions in his video, the baby boomer have already know the consequences of their actions since 1970s. Instead of correcting their mistakes, they chose to ignore them, no matter because of their self interest or unwillingness. This leads to all the disasters and problems of nowadays. In order to prevent further and worse outcomes, we, I mean all living human, need to taken actions immediately. Ken shows some methods to reduce carbon footprint in the previous video. Although shrinking houses and moving to new location might not be plausible for many people, we can still change our living style. We can reduce the usage of cars and switch to public transportations or by bike. We can also eat less meat and change our diet towards veggies. Take a step back, we can reduce our consumption on beef and change it to chicken or other. This will significantly help the reduce of methane. All other ways like reduce wastage and birth control are also plausible and effective in conservation.

Ken, I feel as though in these two videos, you were able to reach the audience with your points for one simple reason. The fact that we were given options to how we could change the way we live to better the future really stuck with me. I feel as though most of the options that were given were not too unreasonable to the average person to try and complete. The main point I want to touch on for these videos is culture. The mindset that most Americans have is to get money, eat meat, have a big family, and a big house out in suburbia. That is the issue, most of us grow up indoctrinated with that in our minds. And when somebody tells us that we need to do something different to save the world its hard to process at times. Like you said, if we had been taught by your generation and the culture was in a more world friendly mindset, the odds of us combating the crisis at hand would be much greater.

I found this one of the most straight forward environmental lectures I've ever experienced, which is probably the most underrated aspect of ES classes. In the past, I have left lectures frustrated with the fact that I knew the problems but couldn't see any clear solutions that I could act upon now, as a college student. In Ken's first lecture, he outlined 5 easy ways to individually cut down our carbon footprint and why that change would matter. Even though I don't have control over everything he talked about,  I was happy that I had been able to check off a few of the boxes. And I can continue to inform my friends and family of the small decisions they can make in their lives. For example, my mom's side of the family shops mainly at Marshall's, which is fast fashion based and eat a lot of meat. I'm excited to see them soon and have the opportunity to spread my  knowledge. And speaking of knowledge, I was also very impressed with Ken's sentiment on how knowledge must be utilized. Every time I see a calling to environmental issue on my instagram feed, I have to question how valid that person's intentions are. Showing that you care versus actually acting are very different things, and I appreciated Ken's recognition between the difference between knowing and doing.

This is particularly alarming. It seems like everything went wrong for climate change. We had so many changes to do something, but each time failed. Both energy crisis of the 70's could have been wake up calls, but instead of heading those warnings we continued and even increased our desire for fossil fuels. Then in the late 2000's momentum again was swinging in favor of Climate change, but the recession hit and there was pressure to increase economic output which meant more fossil fuels. To me these were warnings and missed opportunists. If this would have been stopped in the 70's imagine the world today, but we cannot so its not worth dreaming. I feel somewhat dejected by this notion, if we could not overcome the warnings so long ago, and let other forces control what we thought of in the moment, how can we create change in the future. To me it seems kind of bleak.

<p>
These lecture videos continue to emphasize the things we don’t seem to notice unless they’re put into perspective. The solutions that Ken presented that would cut down our individual footprints were so simple! They don’t take much effort to do, and were indeed more appealing than their counterpart action. Furthermore, when Ken was talking about how the older generation negatively reacts to these same solutions, I realized that I see these same reactions in the older members of my family often. They all immigrated here from the Philippines with little money, and now that they have been able to (rarely) afford material things that they couldn’t in their childhoods, they tend to cling onto them as signs of wealth.
  <br><br>

I can understand why they wouldn’t want to revert back to a “minimalistic” way of living when I consider their backgrounds of poverty. Despite that, I still try to get them to think through their actions more carefully and learn how to do better with their consumption of certain things. Even I need to start adhering myself to these solutions! Lowering our personal carbon footprints may seem like it won’t make a big enough difference for the world to some, but if a whole generation is willing to do it, the effects will be immense.

“If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered.” This quote really stuck with me when I watched the lecture. It rings so true to me. Not only do I see a lack of true information in our society but most people don’t act upon this new knowledge. I can’t be so quick to judge because I do fall under the category of not acting. But I was also misinformed, I had no clue about the severity of our situation and how bad the crisis is. Which brings me to the point that not only is acting on knowledge important but acquiring an adequate amount of knowledge. Of course, the two go hand in hand. If the average individual knew the severity of the crisis they would be much more likely to take action. I believe more is not done because most people don’t understand the crisis is very much here and we don’t have time to ponder. Most students in climate crisis 101 are already significantly more informed and most will go on to make lifestyle changes but there are also millions more that will not receive the same information we are receiving. If the common American kept an open mind and sought out this information it would make a huge difference towards fighting the climate crisis because the severity of the situation is enough to make any person act.

I was well informed about the climate crisis and somehow still fall into the rut of "one person can't change the world," which is such a negative mentality. Ken captured the severity of this problem in such a perfect quote that you restated, but it bothers me constantly that society tends to ignore every single issue that's presented regarding climate change, when the smallest steps can make the biggest difference for the future. Even my family, who never would intentionally hurt the planet, has become subject to convenience over doing our part to save the planet, and through this class i've been able to push for us sustainably shopping and eating locally. I pushed them to get back into the farmer's market grind and now they go every week. It's almost become a fun game to see who can find the nicest okra or the popcorn stand the fastest. Climate change can be battled in a not so serious way too, and genuinely, knowledge is all we need to act upon currently. Slowly large corporations will follow suit.

I plan to take the 5 steps Ken mentioned in his previous video. Those being: transportation, which I will accomplish by taking public transportation and using my bike; housing, in which I will live in an area for college where it shares as much space as possible; waste less food and go to a plant-based diet, where I will watch the amount of food that I buy and make sure that they follow the vegetarian diet; have one child to each person, I plan on only having two children with my future husband; and finally rethink one’s relation to stuff, I look forward to becoming a minimalist and living off of recycled clothing. After I watched his first video I did have the reaction of wanting to start now and looking positively to the change that will happen in my life. 
  <br><br>

After watching the video on, “what the boomer generation knew about the climate crisis- and when we knew it,'' I found a takeaway that we as this generation need to take action since we are experiencing the consequences firsthand. I have a positive outlook that we WILL take action and try our best to put an end to this crisis by taking the steps mentioned in the former. When Ken mentioned, “if acted upon, knowledge is power, otherwise knowledge is power squandered”, a light within me turned on. I now understand that I have the knowledge of the consequences produced by CO2 and it will only change if I act on it. This is an aspect that every person should understand; it’s one thing to say and know it, but it’s another if you act upon it. I choose the former and I hope that my generation does the same.




</p><hr>

<p>
I think the methods (in the aspects of transportation, housing, food waste, raising children, and consumption) that can reduce our carbon footprints mentioned in this video are very practical, and I have already started thinking about implementing them in my life. I found it interesting when Ken discussed the reactions of people from his generation when he confronted them with these ideas that can offset carbon footprint. Apart from material desires, I feel like older generations aren’t willing to sacrifice their lifestyles because they might think their actions are insignificant, and if other people of their generation aren’t doing it, why should they? Anyhow, I do also strongly agree with the notion of “knowledge is power when acted upon” because individual actions can push for collective change. Maybe we are putting too much emphasis on the wrong deeds of the past. What’s done is done and we need to look forward and search for solutions for the future. Although the older generations screwed up in the past, it is still not too late to educate them. At the end of the day every single action matters.

The boomer generation is not solely responsible for the rise of climate change, rather the fossil fuel companies and politicians that chose not to inform the public about the CO2 emissions coming from their consumerism. If fossil fuel companies and politicians had done their job and informed the public about the future CO2 projections, the current state of climate change would not be as bad as it is today. Being informed is one thing, but actually choosing to act upon being informed about the issue is another thing. If the younger generation continues to be manipulated by major fossil fuel companies, climate change will only continue to grow exponentially because we failed to inform the younger generation about our past mistakes and our current ones. Different lifestyles that promote eco-friendly consumerism needs to be lauded, rather than be seen as strange.

I admire Professor Ken and his willingness to address this topic. I have talked with many people from his generation and most all of them are very against the thought that their generation was at fault or aware of any problems. It is quite shocking knowing that large corporations knew about the harm that they were causing the environment many years ago. My dad and I have talked about when he was growing up. He told me stories about so many different events and problems that severely damaged the climate over his life. As I was growing up as well I learned about many problems but one big one was the many oil spills. I mean these spills were awful and just utterly frustrating. I believe Professor Ken is correct that we have to be active with this battle for our generation and the future. The time for waiting and hoping someone or big corporations will finally change is over. If we want real change, we must be active in this fight and make our own moves. Our ice caps are melting, coral reefs dying, forrest burning, land drying. If we dont start to actually make change, the future does not look too long and prosperous.

When Ken brought up how we could help with the climate crisis right now he mentioned moving to a city. My whole teenage life before this video always made me see cities as bad, all the cars and the pollution, the over population. The only benefit I saw of cities is  the accessibility to stores and other places. But as he mentioned this, I realized that maybe cities do have more benefits at least for the climate crisis. When living in rural areas , although there might be less pollution of all sorts, having a car is such a necessity, but since I live in a city grocery stores, schools, libraries, family are all walking distance away. Without even trying My family and I along with other people I know in cities have been subconsciously helping the climate crisis which is just a benefit of living in a city.  As for the other ways to help the climate crisis, I see a lot of these ideas already rooted in younger generations. Many of us don't want to have many children some of us don't want any at all, personally for my own beliefs  I see having children a burden on me and also the earth, because of over population. I have also always like the idea of minimalism, I do not like too have things I don't need or won't use they take up too much space. The only real difficulty I have is with switching to vegetarianism or veganism I have tried but always failed, for now I see limiting my meat consumption as a healthy step forward.

As for the second lecture video, thank you for informing us again on how the boomers messed up the planet, I have strong hopes for the current generation and generations to come.

Ken’s video deeply worried me, with the fatcts that scientists and citizens of the United States have been aware of this problem for so long. Even though they knew this problem was going to happen with the use of fossil fuels, there was no major action to curb or stop it, even when they knew it would threaten our civilization and future generations. For more than 50 years, most scientists and citizens have been aware of the incoming problem yet fossil fuel use still has significantly increased. This short term gratification for the american economy worries me, as we still have not made significant actions to stop it, even with disaster already hitting us. I feel by the time the government and fossil fuel companies decide to do something about it, it will be too late.
  <br><br>
 In 1965, the government released a video entitled “How to Restore the Quality of the 
  <br><br>
Environment”. That was more than 50 years ago and the quality of the environment has been deeply worsened since then. It amazes me how the government accepted it as fact then, yet now is deeply divided over the issue. In the last few decades scientists have found overwhelming amounts of evidence and have done huge amounts of research, just for it to be undone by fossil fuel companies’ manipulation of the media and the public. I never knew how aware the government and people were in the decades before this surrounding this issue. I believe everyone needs to be informed of this crisis, accurately so we feel motivated to take change. There is so much knowledge about this topic, yet it seems almost nobody is taking action because they haven’t been informed enough, and haven’t been properly scared enough to take action.

"If not followed up on, information is power wasted". A lovely quote that summarizes a huge idea.
  <br><br>
I generally contemplate about whether there are more acceptable individuals than worthless individuals in this world and the more I find out about the atmosphere emergency the more I am beginning to address if goodness is a rare characteristic. It truly takes my breath away when I read of CEOs and administrators who are deliberately disregarding the proof and truth of their activities for financial benefits. The brutal truth of things is that we are creeping to the final turning point. We are getting nearer to doomsday. Consistently checks. We should be that change that we need and need. We should be that change now. There are such huge numbers of seemingly insignificant details that we can do that will extrapolate to an a lot more noteworthy and valuable impact. Regardless of whether it be planting trees, strolling/biking to places, reuse everything or simply explaining to someone how they can help.

In the face of climate crisis, our generation should take positive actions. First, we should reduce the use of cars and use other means of transportation such as walking. Secondly, to reduce the scale of living, people can live in the apartment; Then, as meat consumes too much energy, we should develop a vegetarian diet. Then, we should realize that the earth has the most habitable population. We should reduce the increase in population, reducing the burden of the earth. Finally, we need to reduce the amount of daily necessities we buy, which not only take up space but also consume environmental resources. But the most important thing is to pay attention to the current situation of the climate crisis, understand the causes of the climate crisis and take actions to control and improve the climate crisis more effectively.

In Ken’s lecture he talks about in what ways climate crisis happens and what can we do to help with it. Ken listed five ways we can do, such taking public transports or riding bikes instead of driving cars, because cars are producing significant amount of CO2 that will increase global warming; try to live in smaller houses instead of big houses, this will help reduce CO2; reduce the wast of foods and try to eat more vegetables than beef, after we watched Cowspiracy we know that animal agriculture is actually causing a huge destruction in our environment; having no more than 2 children, in order to reduce population growth; rethink about consumerism and consider minimalism, fast fashion has caused serious environmental problems such as polluted water, air, and soils. I like how Ken says :  "If acted on, knowledge is power. If not, knowledge is power squander." We should all put in action.

I thought it was interesting how people since the 1970s knew about what using fossil fuels was doing to the environment but it wasn't that big of a deal. Not until the first energy crisis where there was a gas shortage and it directly affected everyday Americans. This gives us an idea as to how the general public will react to climate change -- nobody will truly care until it affects a great deal of our population. This is similar in present day where disastrous environmental events occur all around the world, but what most people are worried about is what happens in the US. This is a sad truth, however, just because it was this way in the past with the energy crisis among other things, it doesn't mean we cannot change our way of thinking.
  <br><br>


I appreciate that he doesn't want to blame his generation on the climate crisis, even if they are at least partly to blame for it. What we as the newer generation need to do is take note on their mistakes so we do not repeat them, especially for how much climate change has progressed since the 1970s. During the gas crisis, I feel like most people didn't really think to connect the shortage with the environmental damage, only that gas was more expensive and how it was going to affect their daily lives. While this is important, what our generation needs to do is focus on the bigger picture when we see small-scale changes such as this among others that have occurred in the past.

I agree with your comments but I think we need to do more than just not repeat the same mistakes as the generation before us. Although it is great to live with a carbon-free footprint we are at such an urgent state that we actually need to reduce the carbon in the atmosphere until it lowers to a point where the Earth is no longer being harmed. Unfortunately, I think you are right when you said Americans are not inclined to commit to change until a majority of our population is affected. The 70's energy crisis is a good case study to see how we reacted and I think right now we are in the midst of the greatest climate crisis humans have faced, but it does not seem like it because of the lack of change. 
  <br><br>
At this point, I still don't think there is enough media coverage of this and when there is, it's almost always following a natural disaster and the coverage doesn't last long. I wish this climate crisis was as pressing of an issue to the news stations as it really is. If we don't it's easy to forget and put off the severity of the situation and continue treating the planet as we are.

Ken's video was truly impacting as he advised to let his generation serve as a "cautionary tale." I find it fitting that we must not cast blame on anyone but move past that and act to solve the issue. The climate crisis is an issue that will continue to affect people from day to day. I hope my generation will not repeat history and continue to turn a blind eye to the climate change issue. I found this video to be enlightening as resolutions to the issue were made clear. I find that educating people over the issue and helping them understand how they can take part in resolving the issue is what can help to finally quit denying the climate crisis.

"If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered." Thats powerful, Ken! I agree. 
  <br><br>
Here is an anecdote that complements this pro-activism lecture video.
  <br><br>

My family is not from Santa Barbara, where public transit is actually quality, or even where bike paths are marked on roads. I am from Barstow, CA in the Mojave desert, which is basically Nevada in terms of political views and crustiness. Anyways, I was unaccustomed to public transportation. My older brother also came to school here in Santa Barbara. He has since graduated and moved downtown. I don't have a car, for obvious environmental reasons along with my own (seems like too much work and stress). I regularly visit him, and he refuses to pick me up. At first I was annoyed: he has a car, he isn't busy, he just will not drive the 9 miles to come get me. I am a bit of a paranoid person too; as a small young woman, I don't much like traveling by myself. 
  <br><br>
I was upset that he wouldn't just give in and come get me so that we could hang out, it felt kind of rude. Especially him, a person who largely eats a plant based diet, who does not purchase new clothes, etc. he is someone that already exemplifies good and active environmentalism. Why couldn't he just do this one thing that so many other people wouldn't even think twice about? He wanted for me to take the bus. I just wanted him to pick me up.
  <br><br>
But, he wouldn't, he made it clear that he wouldn't. So, I gave up, I started to take the bus. At first I would only go if it were daylight– which is not a bad practice. But now I go at night, still careful, but I know that I don't need to be as afraid as I was. 
  <br><br>
The moral of this story is that, he risked making me upset, he risked the backlash from our parents from not just coming to get me, he put the both of us in an uncomfortable situation for a good cause. I had transportation available to me, I could get there without putting more CO2 into the atmosphere. At first I was mad, but now I understand, and I often opt to take the bus instead of a car somewhere.
  <br><br>
His small (though repetitive and annoying) activism made a difference in the face of the climate crisis.

Your comment reminded me about how easy it can be for many people to make a small step towards reducing their carbon footprint, but because of convenience we often choose to continue living the way we always have. In your case you might have felt like taking the bus was somewhat annoying, but now that you gave it a shot, you seem to prefer taking the bus instead of driving. If more people stick to small lifestyle changes, over time it will become more and more easy to let go of something that is causing them to put more carbon into the air.

  UCSB’s dining commons have Green Mondays where they serve only vegetarian food for the whole day. I think this is a great idea because it pushes many students to try going meatless for one day out of the week and see how much of an impact they make. I believe that if the dining commons keep this up every week, then students will get accustomed to it and it shouldn’t bother anyone that meat will not be served once a week. I believe that this will also help train the students to go meatless once they stop eating at the dining commons and have to cook for themselves one day.


<br><Hr>
 thank you for sharing that personal anecdote! It was interesting read that also added a little way we as people are adaping to climate change and how we can help. As you said it may be annoying at times and add time to our trip, public transportation is definitely the way to go when it comes to helping with climate change. Traveling on buses and trains limits the amount of cars on the road, which directly leads to less C02. Less and less buses are relying on gas for CO2, so, in the end, we can travel emission free. I think it is also neat how many bicyclists there are in Santa Barbara as well as down here by UCSB. Bicycles are completely technologically free, and run on our own energy. This helps the air around us be so much cleaner, and it is definetely noticable compared to Los Angeles. Although we are right by the beach, the small amount of cars actually I feel makes a difference. If more people could commute on bike to work and school, it could help with carbon emissions, or even taking the bus. It's a sacrifice of time and our energy, but this will make a world of difference if many people follow the same practice. The power of one is more than we realize, and with activism, the time to start is always now.

I was really surprised by a lot of the information in this video. Previously, I had been under the impression that most people did not know the consequences of burning fossil fuels. I always assumed that scientists had theorized about these possible detrimental effects but, for the most part, the results of human caused climate change were not made aware to the average person. While I am still skeptical about just how aware most people were (the video implies that most people knew exactly what would happen), it is disheartening to know that people knew and didn't care. I also don't like the way that people tend to dwell on the past when it comes to climate change and blame past generations. I feel that simply focusing on what should have been done is doing absolutely to help the situation. We as a society should be more focused on solutions rather than placing blame and even politicizing this issue.

My mom loves to share stories about her childhood. While watching this video, I remembered one she told me so many years ago. She was born in 1975, two years after the first energy crisis, and grew up in a small town in Northeast Ohio. Her mom, my grandma, was a "reformed hippie," and when gas and fossil fuel prices started to rise, my grandma had her husband install a wood-burning stove in the basement to heat the house. My grandma was not a scientist, certainly not a climatologist, just a young housewife from the middle of nowhere, USA, and yet she was incredibly concerned about our nation's reliance on fossil fuels. Now, almost half a century later, I'm trying to carry that same "hippie" energy. I just don't ever plan on being reformed. 
  <br><br>


We have so much knowledge now, and in theory, power stemming from it. If Ken's generation knew that they were causing a catastrophe for future generations, then what does our generation know while we are living and growing in that catastrophe? If my generation does not act, now, today and tomorrow and the day after that, then there isn't any hope to mitigate the climate crisis. I want to say that there isn't any excuse for someone to not be knowledgeable and concerned and taking action, but after completing this week's readings and watching the documentaries, I've realized that it is naive to say that. If nothing else, the fossil fuel industry knows that knowledge is potential power, and they have an active interest in keeping both knowledge and power out of the hands of the public as much as possible.

“If acted upon, knowledge is power; if not acted upon knowledge is power squandered.” If there is only one-thing I will remember from this class it will be this line, because it’s very true in a lot of different aspects especially when it comes to climate change. We as a human race have accumulated many ways to not stop climate change but to slow it down and if we attempted to see out and act on these plans then there would be more hope in saving our planet. But at the same time these plans take a lot of money which the U.S has but more likely won’t put funds into the climate change matter. Other than that, just like Ken said people could move into smaller homes and change their diet to more of a plant based, I know just for speaking for myself I could do a lot more things to reduce my carbon footprint.

I agree with everyone else's comments, Ken really did have a good lecture on this one. At the end of the day we can only work towards our future and shouldn't dwell on the past! Simply because we do not have the time for it. We simply need action. I saw a couple people posting comments about the "past is the past." I believe that! If boomers and my generation just take action we won't really have to put much blame on anyone. The effects of climate change are an ever growing danger that needs to be taken care of. I love how Ken talks about the fact that we need to take action, and how we need to take it now. I feel there is no time for apologies and I cannot say this enough, immediate action is the only solution. We need to unify and just accept the facts.

It is interesting to hear Ken talk about the 1970’s Energy Crisis because I recently talked to my parents about it and what they remember of it. My dad remembers the lines for gasoline and the spike in the price because he had just gotten his license at the time and so he had to deal with the issue first hand. I think it is surprising that after this crisis, which was now about 50 years ago, the US tried to make a drastic switch to renewables. President Carter even installed solar panels on the White House, just to be taken off a few years later after his presidency by Ronald Reagan. On top of that, our current president doesn't even believe in climate change. The fact that 50 years later we are much further behind than we were is extremely worrisome. It is so frustrating that back then people were aware of what was needed to be done and didn’t act on it. It has further increased environmental issues and has caused people to become even more set in their lifestyles.

I also find it astounding that our current president of our country can simply deny anthropogenic climate change. It goes back to the saying "Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it". Our current generation and those before us have seen these changes come along over time but have failed time and time again to take action. If our generation cannot learn from Ken's generation and others, we are doomed to follow in their footsteps and make the same mistakes as they did.

I find it astonishing that people knew for decades the eventual implications of their actions and still they did nothing to change their behavior. The term "global warming" wasn't well known 50 years ago but people definitely understood that human's fossil fuel and meat consumptions were excessive and detrimental. I was shocked by the fact that there had been studies linking carbon dioxide and global warming as early as the 1800s and still people did nothing to change their lifestyles. It seems that the root of the problem when it comes to people's inaction in the climate crisis is how selfish people are. Companies simply want to make a profit and will do anything regardless the consequence to continue their business. Citizens don't want to give up the luxury of meat eating and filling up their fancy cars with gas. For many people the immediate gratification is more important then the potential long term impacts.

“If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered”. A saying which is going to be commonly used by myself, if you don't mind Mr. Ken Hiltner. I find this class all so fascinating. It really is. So firstly, thank you for that Ken. Secondly, all this has made me really think about the intentions of human beings. I always ponder about whether there are more good people than bad people in this world and the more I learn about the climate crisis the more I am starting to question if goodness is a seldom trait. It really blows my mind when I hear about CEOs and lawmakers who are consciously ignoring the evidence and reality of their actions. What really infuriated me was when I heard that ExxonMobil was warned about the effects of their actions sixty years back but ignored it and are now one of the largest multinationals in the world. I just don't understand how one can profit off the dismantling of the planet and not do anything within their power to change. Now there are two ways I can walk away from this. I can sit here on my laptop on the fifth floor of Davidson Library and complain on youtube about how our planet is largely burning due to prejudiced powerful people or I can tell myself that I am going to make a change. The harsh reality of things is that we are edging to the point of no return. We are edging closer to doomsday. Every second counts. We need to be that change that we want and need. We need to be that change now. There are so many little things that we can do that will extrapolate to a much greater and beneficial effect. Whether it be planting trees, walking/biking to places, recycle everything or becoming the next senator. You are the future.

I agree, Ken has to be one of the most woke Boomers out there, I think of his lectures as mini TED talks. I also agree that it is very nice to be able to consume all of this information on the climate crisis and then rant about it to your like-minded peers in the comment section..
  <br><br>
It is so frustrating that more people in Ken's generation are not only refusing to help fight the climate crisis, but are actively fighting against the movement. The film and reading this week have been so disheartening to me, I hate how politicized this issue has become, mainly by unqualified people fabricating doubt. But it's hard to get American people on board with a movement that requires modesty when we live in a country that fetishizes excess. An anecdotal example, I know a woman who prides herself on the fact that she wears a different outfit every day of the year. It's little things like this that build up to be a huge cultural ignorance regarding the way our actions affect the climate. It's so easy to get into our own bubbles, a lot of people have trouble comprehending how their actions affect others, let alone affect the planet as a whole. Nevertheless, I agree with you that we should narrow our scope to do the things that we can as individuals, push for a better future and hope that's enough.

Evidence that fossil fuels would cause damage to this planet were discovered in the past decades yet no one acted upon it. The saying that "knowledge is power" is true when act upon it, is so true when it comes to the climate crisis. Big fossil fuel companies and scientists knew about it so they had all the knowledge but no power because they did not act to stop it. Instead they just continue to increase the use of methane and CO2 the two of the biggest contributors to the climate crisis. We would not be dealing with this huge problem if actions were taken. Once again climate change should not be a political problem. Ken is right this problem was ignored greating by his generation. 
  <br><br>

Growing up I was taught that you always learn from your mistakes, we as humans are not perfect and have many flaws. In this case the flaw was being lazy and not acting fast. My generation has the pressure to fix the mistakes that the boomer generation did, it is possible and even easy if you say. We need to change how and what we eat on a daily basis. Also what we use so we can help reduce the amount of CO2 in the air. For instance, we all go to UCSB and a great way of transportation is going to school on a bike. Slowly we will begin to see a change. As Ken said don't just gain knowledge but act on it. We as college students are capable of using that knowledge for power.

I used to think Fracking was pretty cool. The people I heard talking about it referred to it as "a new way to get some oil out of America again". (They were some boonk people) I mention this because it relates to a problem I think may have been occurring in the 1970's; people would hear about the "peaking oil" and, instead of using it as a way to cut back on oil use, would use it as a reason to go find some more oil. They may have been concerned with the drying oil wells in America, but once new places for oil sprung up, fears may have relaxed and fossil fuels have continued to be burned. I think that the previous generation might have misplaced their fear by focusing on the wrong parts of oil drying up in America. While some people may have understood the scientific implications of using that much oil, most people probably got caught up on the business end of things.
  <br><br>

I do like how Ken said that little changes amongst ourselves could lead to a large impact. Turning off the lights in the day time, quicker showers, more recycling, or finding a better balance of environmentalism and comfort in each of our lives makes a huge difference.

After watching "What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis- and when we knew it," made me both frightened and skeptical. Frightened of the idea that the boomer generation knew about climate change's potential and seemed to have made very few efforts to change. Made me think of our generation doing the same thing. We have all these expectations to snap out of our ways and save the climate, yet we also always hear that history repeats itself. Are we going to follow in the last generation's footsteps? What makes me a little more optimistic about our future is the skepticism I have about just how much the average American knew back then. I believe that some may have been well informed and many might've known about it, just not about the severity and that a good deal didn't know or accept climate change. It's honestly just a little hard to believe that a majority of people knew about the importance of this issue and then just continue to make it worse. I hope at least that they weren't as informed as Ken made it seem because that would be extremely discouraging. 
  <br><br>

Ken's quote "Knowledge is power only when acted upon," stuck with me. It along with the rest of the lecture really made me see that spreading the knowledge isn't enough. It isn't enough to just know what you're doing is wrong, it's the change that really matters. I see this quote extending to other topics besides climate change. It extends to all of life, to everything we have done, everything we do and everything we will do.

The lecture "Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do" discusses the effect of large houses and properties on climate change. I know someone who has a very large house and property, and funnily enough, he is a climate denier. The american obsession with material goods and "status" is the reason we are so unwilling to turn away from materialism and try and lead more minimalist lifestyles. We, as a society, have been conditioned to believe that the things we own and the more we own, the more important we are. This is fueled by the fact that we have been an entirely capitalist society since the beginning. Instead of having values and basing status off of integrity, intelligence, and compassion (more importantly acting on these values), we base status off of money and possessions. I believe that it would require not only a lifestyle change for the American people to act, but a change of morals. Which unfortunately seems unlikely.
  <br><br>
I agree with what Ken said in this video. We have the knowledge of how and what needs to change but unless we act on it then it doesn't really matter.

It really is insane how materialistic we are as a society. I’ve heard that so many times throughout my life but I never realized just how harmful it really is. Materialism goes hand in hand with jealousy and greed, a direct result of the competitive nature of capitalism that has become a hallmark of the American identity. Everyone works to uphold this system that degrades those who aren’t up to date on the latest fashions or devices. We’re made to feel lesser than if we don’t have the newest iPhone, especially if one can’t afford these luxuries-turned necessities. It’s impossible to work against this system without some form of social reformation, which will never happen as long as the rich are getting richer and the working class is made to think that they must break their back and destroy the environment to be what the rich have called “successful”. We need to stop being so worried about what we’re buying and focus more on the planet dying around us.

I enjoyed the last video that laid out things individuals could do to lower their carbon footprint. It was easy to remember, and the list included enough variety to show that anyone can positively contribute in some way, if not by working to follow all of the individual recommendations. 
  <br><br>

     Concerning this video, I thought it was very interesting that U.S. citizens in the 1970s were concerned about using fossil fuels, but for different reasons than environmentalists today. They saw the problem right in front of them. They were at the mercy of the Middle East, and with political conflict there were shortages(higher prices) of the energy source that powered their cars and heated their homes. The difference today is that the problem has been slowly building up, and much for much of the U.S. population, the effects have not yielded any negative consequences. It's harder to see the problem when many aren't experiencing the effects in their everyday lives. It's hard to see a problem that will do most of its damage in the future. Politicians need to stop confusing their supporters, and people should be getting the correct information. Climate change cannot continue to be treated as if it's not real or not as big a deal as it is.

It really upsets me that my generation has to correct what our predecessors did in the past. Why should we be the ones to suffer from the actions of others? In my opinion, I don't think that my generation alone will be able to fix everything in time. It's going to take at least four to five generations to reverse the things that we are dealing with today. However, changes need to be made now. Temperatures are rising, Australia is on fire, sea levels are rising, and animal populations are decreasing. 
  <br><br>
What Ken’s video made me realize is that knowledge is not power. People back then did know that fossil fuel wasn't good for the environment, however, they continued to use it and dig up more. What is power, is action. And what we need to do is act against these companies who are more profit conscience than environmentally conscious. Knowledge is power when acted upon, not when ignored. For example, a book published in 1971 suggested that those who want to help the planet’s current state should switch to a plant based diet. However, many people ignored this advice and still do today. As a result, my generation is suffering from these decisions. 
  <br><br>


In the meantime, my generation can stop driving as much and instead, ride a bike. Or instead of flying on a plane, ride a boat to other countries. This will help with CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Also, instead of trying to live in a big home, be mindful of the environment and instead live in a smaller house. Now that I am informed, I will limit my time in the shower and try my best to conserve more water. In addition, I will consume less beef because consumption of it will only contribute to the problem. Make sure to not waste food and maybe even switch to a plant based diet. One pound of beef is equivalent to 30 lentils. Not many people know about how harmful animal agriculture is on our planet, and I think everyone needs to be informed. Another thing people can do is have only one child. The population needs to stop growing at the rate it currently is because we will run out of our planet’s resources sooner than later. I am optimistic about the future because more people like myself are becoming aware.

I like these lecture for its positive attitude that I felt and give me hope by telling me what I can do to help with climate crisis. It talks about exactly what we can do now to reduce our carbon footprint and how the climate crisis came to be. And it gives out an environmental friendly lifestyle which is straightforward and easy for us to live. In  "Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do" , it highlighted 5 ways we can do to cut back on our carbon footprint by fifty percent. After watching the lectures, I found that actually most of us are already making effort to help reducing CO2 or methane in the atmosphere. As for me, I always take public transportation or walk instead of driving. In the campus, we can see most students choose to walk or bike to their classroom. There are bike paths and skateboard paths in our campus which can show an environmental friendly campus.

I really resonated with Professor Hiltner’s statement, “My goal is not to cast blame on my generation but rather to see our story as a cautionary tale”. Since I was a child I always questioned why people continued to extract fossil fuels if they knew this would bring about global catastrophes not just for humanity but for all life on the planet. Even I, a ten year old, knew that people in decades past must’ve known that scientists knew what they were doing was bad. I think this class has truly been eye opening for me because I now know that these major corporations DID KNOW that what they were doing was devastating to the planet. Words of apology and regret are not enough. If these policymakers and CEOs of companies are truly sorry they would actually DO something about it instead of just wringing their hands. We are past the point of apologies and denials there needs to be drastic change now if we ever want to fix the mistakes of generations past. There have been so many devastating effects in my lifetime alone: the burning of the Amazon and Indonesian rainforests, the Australia fires, the extinction of hundreds of species, ocean acidification and coral bleaching. I do not want future generations to look at mine and accuse us of doing nothing. In short, I want there to BE future generations.

I completely agree. It seems like the more I learn about the climate crisis the more frustrated and angry I become. The fact that these large corporations and countless politicians are completely aware of how they are affecting the planet and still choose to ignore that for their own benefit is truly disheartening. It makes me so sad that there are so many people in this world that are willing to put themselves above the entire planet. Even with all of the tragedies that have occurred due to climate change within our small lifetimes, there is still close to nothing being done to help. I appreciate that Professor Hiltner cares so deeply about this crisis and is not only educating people about it but also giving us ways that we can help. Despite sometimes feeling like I have no reason to be, I am still very hopeful that our generation will be able to make a difference.

What can we do about it? We can’t stop driving cars using gasoline because electricity cars can’t really support long trips, and we do have admitted that gasoline is still the most efficient energy we have discovered. We can’t stop factory work as well. Many countries base their economies on this, and the pause of factories will create huge rate of unemployment. I mean, many families, they stay in factories for lives; closing factories are like killing them because they can’t do anything besides factory works. It’s easy for us to say we should do something to solve it, but the question is how?

I could not agree more with this statement. I have learned a lot from this class already and honestly makes me sort of sad that I did not even know enough about many of the natural disasters and facts regarding climate change. Also, it is quite maddening that these huge corporations creating a large portion of the CO2 emissions know exactly what they are doing and choose to do nothing about it because they are selfish and care more about themselves and their money than the future generations of the planet.

Both lectures were very eye opening, or at least that’s how I felt. The Earth is everyone's house so anything even the most minimal change that one does, makes a huge difference that impacts the whole world. Isn't it crazy that such simple alternatives mentioned in the first video can actually increase the lifetime of future generations and help to save our planet. The solutions/alternatives that Ken suggested in his first video seems very reasonable and not so hard to implement in our everyday lives. 
  <br><br>

What a better way to end this lecture than with the key to an approach to climate crisis. "Act upon knowledge". Ken mentioned in his video that his generation has known since about 50 years ago the constraints of greenhouse emissions. And although in the 1970’s most Americans feared global warming and its impacts, they chose not to do anything. I had no prior knowledge about the 1970’s Energy Crisis due to a shortage of oil, thus the US had to rely on imported oil. Scientists warned the US about the repercussions from excessively extracting the earth’s natural resources and not only the experts in climate, but even the most average American, knew that they needed to switch to renewable energy. They knew about the impact of the meat market, the fossil fuels, and most importantly they knew what to do. Nonetheless, they ignored all of these and instead of using their knowledge towards progress, it never became power. So now it is our duty to act upon our knowledge, we can’t afford to repeat the same mistakes, but what can we do? Educate ourselves and educate future generations such as our kids about the current crisis, that sadly has been going on for a while.

I agree with you, the lectures really opened my eyes about how we got to this point in time. The suggestions on how to cut our carbon footprint seemed so easy. I remember a couple years ago my mentality was that of the older generations. We are so blinded by the trends that are going on around us that we don’t even notice that we’re making our planet worse. I used to want a bigger house, more clothing, just more or what others had. Now after learning more about climate change and seeing that it actually is a problem my mentality has changed. It seems so realistic and easy to do all the 5 things that could cut our carbon footprint in half. That’s sort of the trend amongst people who are educated about what’s happening with the planet. We just need more people to get on board with these ideas. 
  <br><br>
The 1970’s Energy Crisis came as a surprise to me as well, oil was scarce and the importation of oil began. Apart from this, people knew that they needed to stop the use of these fossil fuels yet they didn’t because they didn’t know how much of an impact it was actually making. Like you said they knew meat and fossil fuel was bad but like previously said multiple times, people won’t do much about it until they actually feel the impacts themselves. I agree with you, we need to educate our youth and it’s up to us and them now to try and fix what has been happening for years. Like professor Hiltner said, “Knowledge is power only when acted upon”. What's good about knowing something if we aren’t going to help, our knowledge is key to changing these impacts.

Thank you for giving us such a straight-forward answer to what we can do to improve the climate crisis. Having clear cut lines on what makes an environmentally friendly lifestyle makes these lifestyle decisions much easier to make. I may not stick to every point you made 100% for my entire life, but the conscious awareness you have given me will certainly impact many of my future life's decisions. I already catch myself thinking about the environmental impacts of my actions in every aspect of my life. I don't always make the right decision (sometimes the char burger looks too good), but this class has certainly made my lower my carbon footprint drastically. You say if not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered, but no person has to totally and radically change their lifestyle to cause a significant difference. I believe the accumulation of small decisions -- such as choosing chicken rather than beef -- will have profound impact. I can't promise that I'll go vegan or never buy a house, but I will always remain conscious of the impact of my decisions and act accordingly. 
  <br><br>

I find it hard to believe that any random person on the street during the 70's would be "worried" about climate change. Well educated scientists and politicians were certainly aware, but I see very little media from the time covering this topic, at least compared to today. I don't blame the general public at the time for not being worried enough to change their lifestyles. We already see drastic effects of climate change today and are only just starting to drastically change our lifestyles. I blame the scientists and journalists of the past for not doing a good enough job of informing the public of the effects of greenhouse gasses.

<p>
Ken’s quote, “If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered” really resonated with me. Growing up, I used to always hear, “Knowledge is Power,” yet what good is knowledge if we do not act upon it? We had the knowledge that the consequences of our actions will have a catastrophic effect on our planet if we did not change our lifestyles. By 1970, many Americans knew that if we do not slow the rate of consumption of fossil fuels, our civilization would end. So why is it that even to this day, are we not acting on this knowledge? Our inability to act upon the knowledge that we had simply made this problem much harder than it had to be. It makes me wonder how different our world could have been if we had simply acted decades ago when we first knew of the problem. 

  <br><br>

The changes to our lifestyles that Ken mentioned in his previous video were simple ones to make. It did not require as drastic of a change to our current lifestyles as some people make it out to be. I was quite shocked to learn that such five simple changes can have that large of an impact on our carbon footprint. Knowing this now, it definitely motivates me to put more effort into curbing my carbon footprint and reduce my contribution to the climate crisis.

I too was really struck by the quote “If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered”. I think the older generations and the newer generations are obsessed with knowledge and most people are proud of being educated or knowledgable. However, when knowledge of something that requires inconvenient action surfaces, people ignore it and deny it. It does not make sense. What is the point of being educated if you aren't willing to act on it? 1970 was half a CENTURY ago and were still making barely any progress with a problem that is only getting worse. 
  <br><br>

I think it is so important to address lifestyle changes people can make. If everyone chose only 1/5 changes that Ken suggested, that would be such a huge move in the right direction. I have been plant-based for a year and it makes me laugh to think about how I used to be one of those people who would say "oh I could never give up meat/dairy/cheese". People do not even try, I did not even try. All that is seen is the inconvenience and people stop there. Especially in Southern California, it is so easy to not eat meat. Almost any restaurant or grocery store has endless options. Even just meatless Mondays makes a huge difference. I just wish more people had open minds to try new things especially when the survival of the planet is on the line.

<br><hr>
as Ken stated, many Americans knew that our practices were going to affect the planet, but remained ignorant. This is due to personal preferences of not wanting to shift lifestyles, but it’s also because the environment that we’ve all been brought up in has not pushed us in any other direction. We’ve become accustomed to having basic necessities readily available for us that there’s even a surplus. There’s simply no motivation or collaborative effort to making a change, but I think it’s time we start. To prevent this generation from making the same mistakes as the Boomer generation, it’s important to know just how much our lifestyle and choices impact society and our planet as a whole. Ultimately, we’re coinhabitants of the same place, yet there is so much focus on disagreement on whether or not the climate crisis is even real. Like you said, these simple changes would tremendously help in mitigating the crisis if more people felt inclined to do so. I believe in the trickle down/domino effect. If people start pushing action by making lifestyle changes and spreading awareness, there may be hope for future generations.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with the foundational statement that knowledge is power on if it is acted upon. And I think it is perfect to describe the way the couple of generations before us have treated climate change. I also think it is a very interesting aspect of environmental ethics, the dissonance or the disconnect between knowledge and action. There exists this moral question, that I believe our previous generations have answered selfishly, that if we know the climate is changing… do we have an obligation, or should we do something about it? I think that the previous generation has made up their mind about the answer to that question, whereas we should be going in the opposite direction – taking action, as opposed to knowing we should.

While I admit that the suggestions for actions against climate change that Ken suggested are personally challenging, I believe I would be able to carry them out. However, my greater concern is can everyone else do it as well? As mentioned before, many Americans believe their way of life and freedom is endangered with policies or demands to combat climate change. Without understanding and initiative to take action, as Ken discussed with the power of knowledge, then effective results won’t occur. The five suggestions may require most people to completely change their lifestyle and what they are used to but are fundamental for reducing carbon footprints that have endangered our environment anyways. I was very surprised about the information regarding the 1970’s Energy Crisis in which Americans knew about the need to reduce fossil fuel usage. It makes me wonder how the nation hasn’t completely transitioned to renewable energy usage if the problem has been even 50 years ago. If five decades won’t lead to instrumental change then it honestly discourages any optimistic thoughts for the future for the American public. In addition to my same surprise is the information about how scientist Eunice Foote acknowledged that carbon emissions were contributing to rising global temperatures, literally providing evidence from over a century ago and yet skepticism is still prominent now. While our society depends on the intense energy supply from oil and other fossil fuels, I would think that politicians have already taken the initiative for transforming our economy to revolve around renewable energy sources rather than limited sources like oil that will lead to dependence and energy crises similar to the one in 1970. As inspired before by the benefits of a vegan diet for our body and its benefit for our environment, I was motivated to attempt to try this, and although it was difficult, I know with the proper research revolving around diet and nutrition without meat would adequately prepare me to transition.

<p>
I think it is very interesting how people 50 years ago saw the need to switch to renewable energies and a plant based diet but for reasons other than because of climate change.  What's ironic is that their reasons are still viable today as nonrenewable energies do not provide stable jobs and a permanent, stable fuel source.  That plus the climate crisis should be more than enough reason to seek for regulations for fossil fuels and carbon emissions.  However, if Ken is correct in claiming that the average American in the 1970's wanted to end our reliance on fossil fuels and excessive meat, then their ideologies have drastically changed since they are now the generation that rebuke fossil fuel regulations and climate change scientists.  Even if their ideology was influenced due to simply how they have become older, now knowing that they will not be a part of this Earth when we start to feel the worse of climate change, their primary reasons for being worried because of the energy crisis would still be viable.  The only reason I would think that their minds would change is because of the disinformation campaign.  This really shows the power of influence behind the deceptive media that fossil fuel industries have been able to effectively use.  Scientists have an uphill battle against the wealth of these industries as fossil fuel industries are able to invest so much money in their disinformation campaigns.  In the end, capitalism clouds the minds of our democracy, and this makes it even more difficult to pass enough legislation to battle against climate change.

When Ken was first mentioning that we have known about this climate crisis for far longer than we like to believe, I didn’t realize to what extreme this was true. When I heard the date 1854 I was astonished as that is way earlier than I ever thought even feasible. It is so saddening to me to know that a woman in the 1800’s found that CO2 emissions would lead to temperature rise and no one listened. I also think another saddening fact is that our very US presidents were informed about this in the 60s and it has gotten to where it has today. I think it is so sad that Jimmy Carter had solar panels put on the roof of the white house as a step in the right direction and as an example for the rest of the country, and they were quickly after removed and little progress was made. A concept that was new information to me was how the average American from the “boomer” generation knew that burning fossil fuels was bad and so was eating meat, but they didn’t know the link it had to what would’ve been labeled as climate change. 
  <br><br>
I thought a really powerful part of this lecture video was the way in which Ken handled talking about his generation's role in all of this. I thought he did a really good job of balancing perspectives as he did not grant them a free pass for ignorance but also don't blame the whole thing on them. This was a great way to approach it as it educates about what information they had access to and what it was like to be in their shoes. I think it is perfect to deem it as a cautionary tale as that is exactly what it is. It is objectively what not to do, so we need to talk about it so we dont let it repeat with our generation. We make no progress by condemning the generation who proceeded us, as we must learn from it and take action. I also thought the knowledge and power point was a very powerful way to close the lecture. Us being in this course, we are collecting knowledge of this crisis. But that in itself is not power. It is the educated actions we will take after long after this quarter to help our earth that will be the most powerful.

<p>
It is quite amazing that 50 years ago, and even sooner before then in the mid 1800’s(at least), people already knew that consumption of fossil fuels would lead them down a dangerous road that could spell disaster for the earth. Everyone who knew this information, understood it, and agreed with it, should have had a moral obligation to educate people around them and started making changes towards reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. But unfortunately, they didn’t. I understand that it is difficult to see the implications of our actions when there is no real tangible evidence, but that is when we need to trust our scientists, especially those who devote their lives to understanding the consequences of our actions, and use their knowledge to change how we behave as a society. As Ken said, we need to act on knowledge, not just accept something and move on as if it changes nothing in our lives. Doing something productive with new information is the key in making progress both individually and as a global community. Now we can clearly see the consequences of ignoring information and science, and I hope that my generation can actually show that we are capable of changing in light of new information. I think we’re on our way but we still have a long way to go.

I grew up in Los Angeles, and have been residing there all my life. It was crazy because before watching this video, I always assumed that we contributed the most to pollution. I mean being out there, and finally being able to see stars when I moved to Santa Barabara seemed like a strong indicator for this thought. But you mentioned, that of the five ways we can alleviate climate change’s consequences, housing was one of them and transportation was another. Being in the city, I have noticed that in small ways we’ve tried to encourage the use of environmentally friendly options. For example, an emphasis on carpooling which the city encourages in freeways by providing a designated lane for people who carpool. While this may not seem much, Los Angeles has the worst traffic and seeing that vehicles that are carpooling have a bigger advantage at avoiding an extra hour on the freeway is very appealing. Though, I’m not saying that cities aren’t doing the most they can to help the climate crisis, but it really places an emphasis that some people will not change their accustomed ways unless there is a direct benefit to them, and while delaying the eventual destruction of the planet should be a strong motivator, there is no direct result. People cannot see the fruits of their efforts and so they do not do it. 
  <br><br>
The five ways that you mentioned on how my generation could help the climate crisis was appealing, but it still does not guarantee we will act accordingly. Watching, I’ve concluded that the reasons older generations do struggle with making necessary changes are because of convenience and entitlement. And how do you change that mindset with a generation who grew up on the ideology of freedom and hard work? The same ideology that my generation was raised on?
  <br><br>

In this video, “What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis – and when we knew it,” you even address that despite not knowing about climate change specifically, your generation knew that something was up and changes were needed. In the 70s, you had your first energy crisis where every average American was affected, and from that point, you already came to the conclusion that you needed an alternative choice to oil. You mention that your generation had all the facts and chose to ignore it.
  <br><br>

“If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered.” This quote resonated with me because it emphasizes the idea of ignorance. And it made me think of Socrates, “There is only one good, knowledge, and one evil, ignorance.” Will ignorance be humanity’s destruction? And if your generation had all the facts, yet chose to ignore them, what guarantee do we have that our generation won’t do the same? 
  <br><br>

I am genuinely afraid for the end of the world, and the fact that that’s not an exaggeration is even more frightening. Despite the doubt I cast on my generation, I also carry hope because of the small changes we have made in our lifetime. Though small, they still instill some kind of change. I completely agree that “Knowledge is knowledge and little more…for it to become power we must act on knowledge” because I think that just by being aware, we make unconscious decisions that alleviate the climate crisis.

I agree with everything Ken suggests to lower our carbon footprint except changing what we eat. I am not doubting the fact that the beef industry is strongly related to global warming. During a cow's lifetime, it emits tons of methanes which is a much more problematic GHG than carbon dioxide. The reason I will not give up eating beef is simple: it is just so delicious. Who wouldn't want to have a mouthwatering thick and juicy steak for dinner? Even there are other substitutions like chicken has pretty much the same nutrients as beef, the taste of beef is unique. I eat beef every day but my net footprint should be relatively low because I am using public transportations a lot and doing all other helpful ways to reduce my footprint such as driving an electric car etc. 
  <br><br>


In my opinion, our obsessed consumption of fossil fuels is a much more important global warming contributor and we should focus on the main cause rather than on the secondary causes. Humans like all other mammals also fart and there are definitely more humans than cows on this planet. If we solves the beef problem that will probably only cut the GHG emission by a tiny amount. Therefore, reducing beef production, as well as other agricultural restrictions, are not as effective as industrial control on helping our planet.

I was a little taken aback to see that the average person was aware of the consequences of fossil fuels so early on into our usage of them. We had known when we would see temperature increases, but climate change continued to be treated on-and-off as an issue. The previous generation seems to have taken on the mindset that "yes, we know that what we're doing will significantly, negatively, impact the planet, however since we cannot immediately see said consequences and there is a degree of comfort to using fossil fuels, we will continue to live every day normally". 
  <br><br>

Perhaps this is an odd comparison to make, but this class makes me feel as if I am going through the stages of grief/loss... except that it isn't a person, but the entire planet that's ill and I'm coming to terms with its close-to-inevitable death. Although some of the content that we have covered in class makes me terribly upset and the sentiment definitely bleeds into the comments section of these videos, I know that playing the blame game will not contribute anything positive to the climate cause. The deed has been done and as Ken mentioned, we should prioritize individual efforts to lower our carbon footprints.

I'm actually pretty sympathetic to the people that were genuinely concerned about the climate in the 70's. It's really frustrating that policymakers have been actively betraying Americans for so long, ignoring their wishes to see legislation passed about this issue. The problem would have been slightly better if people started living sustainably, but it is not until giant companies, who have the most to lose financially by switching to renewables, are actually held accountable that this issue will be able to see any resolution. This, of course, doesn't mean individual actions are meaningless. All I mean is that citizens are a powerful force, but we do not have the sneaky destructive capabilities they do. Instead, we must create the environmental revolution. This, of course, will be a mix of changes in policy and lifestyle. Culture changes, but ours is stuck.
  <br><br>
And I want to personally reach out to you and say that even though everything won't be okay, but community is powerful. We can create big change locally, and that's how we make our world seem better. It's impossibly exhausting, but we can do it. And if we all die from a rogue natural disaster caused by climate change, we die together.

During the first half of the first lecture video, professor provides several ways that our generation could follow to reduce our impact on climate change. I personally find the most durable ways to be recycling clothes and stop wasting food. Many of the times I throw away or donate clothes that are not really worn, yet I still want to buy new clothes knowing that I will possibly not wear them very often. Recycling clothes would really help me with tidying up my closet. Food waste is another problem I find happening on myself. Sometimes one serving is just too much for one meal, and I could have asked for take out boxes. Food and clothing industries are two main contributors to the carbon dioxide emission. However, sometimes these ways of reducing our carbon footprint are found contrary to life standards. An example would be public transportation. Gas is definitely a scarce and limited resource, and it would result in energy crisis once we run out of fossil fuel on earth.  
  <br><br>

The second lecture video says that even knowing how catastrophic climate crisis could be, many people still didn’t react to that situation in the early 1970s. Within decades humans burned a mass amount of fossil fuels that had been slowly accumulated on earth for over 500 years, and with the burning of fossil fuels comes the 25% increase in carbon dioxide, which can result in drastic change in climate. The main issue is that we all know that climate change is a problem, but we don’t know how catastrophic it could be.

The most impressive sentence Prof.Ken said in the lecture  is “Knowledge is power only when acted upon otherwise knowledge is power squander!” The reading I read last week “2 ℃ Beyond the limit” depicted Santa Barbara as environmental poseurs as it is “all talks, no actions”, which is a good evidence to support the sentence “knowledge is power squander”. Santa Barbara has already realized the climate change might bring some horrible consequences to them and then initiated the modern environmental movement in 1895 to control the rise of temperature within 2 ℃. But they refuse to take actions as people are reluctant to sacrifice convenience in exchange for reducing emission of carbon dioxide! The example of Santa Barbara does match the statement Prof.Ken claimed in the lecture that his generation has already foreseen the terrible results burning fossil fuels would bring to the next several generations but they refuse to take changes like utilizing renewable energies to supplant fossil fuels until recently! They are unwilling to throw up the great benefits burning the fossil fuel generates. Thus, to them, knowledge is power squander! Today, as the young generation grows up, we should turn our knowledge to power instead of squander. It is our duty to make some changes to protect our planet! And surprisingly, the changes we can take are not very difficult! In lecture “Can one generation do what previous generation failed to do”, Prof.Ken pointed 5 ways we can do to reduce the global warming effects.
  <br><br>

Taking public transports and bikes instead of driving cars
  <br><br>
Living in a smaller house
  <br><br>
Raising no more than 2 children
  <br><br>
Consuming fewer beef and intaking more vegetables 
  <br><br>
Changing consumer preferences
  <br><br>

Althouse those five changes seem may raise some inconvenience to us, they are the most simple changes we can make in our daily life. It is true that driving cars is the most efficient transportation ways since we can get directly to our destination. Public transportation can greatly reduce the emission of CO2 comparing to the private cars in that on the same amount of emission of CO2, it can help much more people to arrive to their destinations. As for eating habits, it is understandable that some of us may not be used to be a vegetarian. Thus, we can use chicken, duck and etc. to supplant the beef as proteins to intake, which can reduce the emission of methane. 
  <br><br>

In short, it is inconvenient at the very start that changing our daily habit. However, the changes are full of meaningful contributions. An individual’s change seems useless to the environment, but a group of individuals’ changes will predominantly contribute to our society!

It was surprising to me that most Americans in the 1970s believed that we needed to end our reliance on fossil fuels by the end of the 20th century, especially since our dependence has increased since then. It is also important to consider how strongly they held these beliefs. Just because they had the idea of renewable energy in mind does not necessarily mean that they cared enough to act on it. Their motivations for these beliefs were also more egocentric, as they were backed by the energy crisis in 1970 when the price of oil and gasoline rose. People wanted to move away from fossil fuels primarily for economic reasons, rather than environmental reasons that consider the future of all humans and living creatures on earth. It is also upsetting that in the video, Ken mentioned that his generation’s unawareness of the magnitude of climate change serves as an excuse that “lets them off the hook.” Being uninformed about the climate crisis is a choice, as the information is widely accessible. It was his generations’ choice to ignore the warnings, and it is therefore unacceptable to plead ignorance.

  <br><br>

I find it ironic that even with more research and wider media coverage about the climate crisis today, the same generation that claimed they “didn’t know better” in the past still fails to address the issue. In the other lecture video, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?”, many members of Ken’s generation are so comfortable with the fossil-fuel reliant lives they’ve established that they are unwilling to engage in any of the personal changes listed in the video. I think many people fail to realize that making an impact on the climate crisis doesn’t require you to live a perfect, zero-waste lifestyle; rather, each person making a small lifestyle change, such as buying less clothes or choosing to eat chicken over beef, is still effective when enough people choose to do it. In this mindset, taking action does not have to be an intimidating task that scares people away from attempting to make a difference.

I was shocked to hear the first time carbon dioxide was linked to global increases in temperature was done in 1854. We have been complacent about this issue for nearly two centuries. Why have we ignored this issue for so long? It is absurd that environmental activism has only recently gained momentum with the dedication of Greta Thunberg. Not listening to scientific data is reckless. For many years we have been warned over and over again of the threat of continuous and increasing carbon dioxide emissions. The climate crisis should have been taken seriously a long time, however it hasn't because it remains largely political. A crisis such as this shouldn't be debated to the extent that prohibits any large scale action to be taken.
  <br><br>
I find it very frustrating that as citizens we turn to our government for protection and yet our nation isn't protecting us from the threat of climate change. In order to make a large scale difference, we need the aid of the government. Whats holding our government back from intervening in this issue? We elect people who would rather take the money from fossil fuel companies than to listen to the data that hundreds of scientists are providing. Not only are our officials not listening to scientists, they are not listening to their citizens. Worldwide we are screaming for action, and we receive little to no response in return. 
  <br><br>
If our government won't take action, we must. Not only should we make lifestyle changes in order to live sustainably, but we also have to use our power of voting. We need to elect officials who are passionate about this issue and are dedicated to make a change.

Although the world population has known about global warming for decades, yes, people should have been more alarmed in the 20th century but there were other pressing issues in the world at the time like the Vietnam War. However, it is frustrating to know that Obama tried to raise awareness on the climate crisis during his 2008-2012 presidential term, like through the cap-and-trade bill, and yet instead of continuing to push for climate reform, climate change denial groups gathered money to shut down all speculation that rising temperatures is human caused. The awareness of the climate crisis really got shut down after the bill vanished in the Senate and climate change was pushed to the back of people’s minds or people were not convinced that it was a pressing issue/ human caused. Fast forward 10 years, now climate change is one of the biggest topics for the upcoming presidential term. If people would have realized the facts 10 years ago, we would now be much further in combatting CO2’s effects. Instead, we are many years behind, and I’m tired of hearing that people know the facts, risks, and dangers and yet don’t act to try and solve the climate crisis.

it is very frustrating that climate change was a pressing issue during the beginning of the Obama administration, yet it was pushed to the side. If we would have acted back then, we would not be in the same situation we are in today. Now, we must have drastic change in order to keep warming below 2 degrees which is very unfavorable to those who oppose any change. If we would have started acting on this issue 10 years ago, the solutions needed today would be much more palatable for the average American.

As Ken mentioned, there are five aspects that we can do to reduce our CO2 footprint to mitigate climate change. 
  <br><br>
1. Transportation
  <br><br>
People who own cars and drive cars are producing a quarter of their individual CO2 footprint. Therefore, taking public transportation can effectively reduce CO2 emissions.
  <br><br>
2. Housing
  <br><br>
Housing accounts for another quarter of people's CO2 footprint. People tend to live in a big house, especially, the people who live in suburban or rural homes. It is better to live in a micro-apartment or co-housing community which can greatly reduce CO2 emissions.
  <br><br>
3. Eating
  <br><br>
Wasting less food and eating plant-based diets are good ways to reduce CO2 footprint. Since lots of CO2 will be emitted to the atmosphere by producing meats, people should eat more plant-based diets. Furthermore, food production is the second-largest producer of greenhouse gases, people shall not waste food.
  <br><br>
4. Having fewer children
  <br><br>
A couple should not have more than 2 children, because the planet can not sustain so many people, and it will collapse if the population is too huge. 
  <br><br>
5. Rethinking the relationship to stuff
  <br><br>
 Manufacturing clothes will also produce lots of CO2, so people should purchase clothes rationally. Also, they should not follow the fast fashion, and they should not be fascinated by consumerism. I think minimalism is the most sustainable way to counteract climate change.
  <br><br>
Moreover, Ken pointed out that the notion of climate change is proposed in 1854s. However, the name "climate change" is figured out in 1956s. Although the public did know climate change in the early 1970s, they came to know that what they had done would lead to disastrous consequences to the planet. For example, they experienced an energy crisis, because they found out that they are getting less and less oil from underground. Also, they gradually know that producing meats will release lots of methane which is problematic environmentally. Hence, they were worried about the problem. Nevertheless, they did not act by using the knowledge. 
  <br><br>
It is a cautionary tale told by Ken to remind us to take action after we learned the knowledge. Knowledge is power only when we act on knowledge.

I really agree with professor Ken that knowledge without actions or applications will just be knowledge. This is why learning is important. Learning is the encouragement of creations. Remind me of a Chinese old saying that: “to under ten thousand books that you read, you have to travel ten thousand miles.” To those who don’t believe climate change is real, reading from news and books about what happened is not enough to assert. To those who don’t think climate change is in urgent need of attention, collecting data and references are not enough to judge. Go out and look at the lost beautiful sceneries. Go and check the burned little town. This is important to understand that climate change is in urgent need of attention, and it is indeed affecting or threatening people’s lives right now. Whether you believe in human-caused climate change or not, protecting the earth is all human beings’ responsibility. Otherwise, where can we call home?
  <br><br>

I am surprised by the fact that, in 1854, there is already a scientist alarming people about the greenhouse effect. I also feel sad about this, because nearly two hundred years of alarming didn’t make the majority of people change or act, even with the Energy Crisis in the 1970s. According to the temperature rise and climate disasters that happened in recent years, we probably don’t have another two hundred years of knowledge collecting. We need to act as soon as possible.

Before watching this video lecture I was not aware of just how early scientists were able to determine that climate change was caused anthropogenically. It is incredibly frustrating that in 1854 scientists were already warning people about the future consequences of our actions and were met with skepticism and had their hard work dismissed. Despite how frustrating it is to learn that people have been ignorant for so long it is not surprising because even today there are people that refuse to acknowledge the truth for either their own personal gain or simply out of denial. It is also not surprising that Eunice Foote’s research was written off because as a woman she was not given the respect she deserved as a scientist, much like Rachel Carson. There are obviously many cases of problematic misogyny that are constantly seen throughout history in regards to women scientists, but even research being done by men on the climate was being ignored. In 1956 Gilbert Plass published an article about the effects of CO2 on our atmosphere but still the public did nothing in response. Environmental scientists have and most likely always will be met with the challenge of convincing people of simple and observable facts.
  <br><br>


What makes things even more worrisome is that it was not just scientists who have known about this issue for so long. Fossil fuel companies, who still actively encourage our addiction to fossil fuels today, have known about the disastrous effects of CO2 since the 1970s. Due to their selfish hunger for wealth they have worked to deny anthropogenic climate change and continue to make false claims about their supposed innocence in this crisis. It has been several decades since the 1970s and not only have we continued to use fossil fuels but we have grossly increased our use of them despite our growing knowledge of anthropogenic climate change. Although the 1970s had some small superficial changes that attempted to show an effort toward improvement, such as the addition of solar panels to the White House, we have overall made a very small dent in what we really need to change since then. 

  <br><br>

We have also known about the effects of our diets for quite some time as evident in the publication of “Diet for a Small Planet” by Frances Moore Lappe in 1971. Due to the book being a bestseller during the 1970s it is clear that even when we are presented with facts and advice we are rarely receptive and continue with our bad habits. This refusal to change even when given the clear reasons to do so are in line with Professor Hiltner’s statement that “knowledge is not power, acting upon knowledge is power.” Today there is a definite increase in veganism and overall more environmentally conscious diets but there is still a stigma around these lifestyles because America is so iconically carnivorous. In the original “American Dream” there was often a clear image that came to mind of a white picket fence and a barbeque in the yard, but it is far past due that we rewrite our culture to be more thoughtful about consumption.

What I've gathered from this video is that the reason we don't act on climate crisis isn't that we don't know what's causing it, but simply because we don't care enough. The first date Ken brought up was all the way back in 1854. They knew carbon dioxide would eventually do some damage to our Earth, so there is no excuse for why we wouldn't know this now. If anything, we should be so advanced on this topic that it's no longer a problem. 166 years of this information? And we still aren't ALL on board with the fact that if we don't change our ways we will be extinct-or on the verge- in 20  years? Or do we also just not care about that? I personally eat meat but have consciously been reducing the amount of it in my diet. I feel like my generation is one of the only ones willing to make lifestyle changes, like diet, not only for the earth but for their well being. I live with 6 girls and only  2 of us eat meat. I feel like that is a statistic that has gone way up now that we are feeding ourselves. I also think it's safe to say the majority of my friends do not eat meat. if these numbers continue to go up, I see a brighter future for our planet, but changing our diets alone will do close to nothing if the big businesses don't stop burning fossil fuels, fracking, and polluting our oceans and skies.

Because I’ve focused on my disappointment on the people in power during the climate crisis in previous comments, I want to talk about Ken’s suggestions for personal changes in this comment. Ken suggested three notable things: changes to transformation (taking the bus, biking, or walking instead of using a personal car), changing to a largely plant-based diet, and making changes to consumer-habits (such as thrifting, smaller housing, etc.). For each I realized that I have so many more questions. I do feel that in college, changing transformation to this is quite easy, but I have to ask about after college. For some people that must commute, these options simply aren’t realistic- so my question is if having electric cars is a good alternative or if that doesn’t really make much of a difference because they may harm the environment in other ways? Second, on the topic of a plant-based diet: does that mean veganism or vegetarianism? Is being a pescatarian still respectable considering that you have mainly only demonstrated the flaws of the beef industry or is fish also an issue? I know that this comment isn’t really a comment as it’s composed primarily of questions, but I for one do want to make beneficial lifestyle changes and simply want to find the best way that also is realistic for me to do it.

I have heard many times from those defending the lack of action by older generations that they did not know of the gravity of the climate crisis at the time. Therefore, I find it very interesting after watching this lecture that the issues of the climate were common knowledge and were quite well known before present times. This is a frustrating fact to learn, as it shows the selfishness and ignorance of the Boomer generation by their choice not to live with an awareness for the environment and the coming generations. However, it is even more frustrating that, despite their knowledge of these issues in the past, they now have no excuse not to take action and yet they still refuse to do so. It seems that the majority of the difficulty to gain progress on the climate initiative does not stem from the commonly progressive youth, but from these older generations, once again. It makes little sense how the people that failed us from the start still refuse to help save us now. 
  <br><br>

The idea that knowledge is not power is also interesting and, framed in this new context, makes much more sense. Simply being aware of an issue does not change anything, as one must put action toward it to truly make a difference.

<p>

Ken really hit the nail on the head with this lecture. "If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered." This quote speaks immeasurable truths that can relate to every facet of our lives. It's unbelievable how early we knew about the effects of climate change, but what is even more unbelievable is how long it took us to address these issues. Imagine how different our world would be right now if we had originally built our cities based off of renewable energy sources. Who knows, maybe the technology would have evolved to become fifty times as cheap and efficient as it is now. If knowledge is power squandered, then our previous generations have squandered an unfathomable amount of power.
  <br><br>

But, what's done is done. We can't rewrite history and change the past. The knowledge and power to make a difference is in our hands now, and now we finally have a chance to make a difference. I now know that I will make my best conscious effort to adhere to the principles that Ken outlined in this series of video lectures. Sure this means that I won't be able to live the most comfortable and easy life, but comfort is not something that we can afford anymore. If change is to happen, it needs to start now.

I really like how you stated that we are unable to rewrite the past and our only option now is to move forward with a more conscious attitude on this topic.  I agree that it is simply unbelievable how early we knew about climate change and how little we did to address the issue.  It is disheartening to think that 50-60 years ago people had the power to reduce the impacts that the climate crisis would have on the planet.  It is even more unsettling to think about the ways in which people simply dismissed this issue and instead multiplied the size of homes, commodities and modes of transportation.  The way you admitted to not being able to live the most comfortable and easy life in the near future is really venerable and made me realize that I will also have to make sacrifices in order to do my part in reducing climate change impacts.  Because knowledge without action is simply useless, we are more prompted than ever to take action and begin reevaluating our everyday decisions.


<br><hr>
I agree with you saying that the knowledge and power to make a difference is in our hands now, it is unfortunate that such a large burden was passed onto this generation and we are left to clean up the mess that we ourselves did not make.  Looking into the past and the start of the modern world I’m sure people then did not know how great the consequences of their actions would be, but clearly it came to a point where humanity became aware of what would happen.  We will have to sacrifice a lot but I know it will only make it easier for future generations to come.  If we can use our knowledge as power now then there will be hope.
<br><hr>
As it currently stands, our current environmentalist movement shares shocking similarities to that of Ken's generation. In both, information was widely spread (Diet for a small planet vs the government chair of science comprehensive global warming report), both gained heavy traction ( solar panels in white house vs caps and trade passing the house), and lastly both lost that traction ( removal of solar panels vs caps and trade failing plus removal of most climate activists politicians). I feel as if right now, the current environmentalist movement is reminiscent of that of Ken's generation. There are very few of us and, for the most part, we are a dedicated fan-base to the planet. Currently, the knowledge that virtually everyone in our generation possesses is awfully close to being squandered as the majority of people, including our generation are not willing to act upon this knowledge. 
  <br><br>


Sadly, I believe that our generation will do what Ken's generation knew and failed to do, once it is absolutely necessary and way too late. Historically, every major societal change has been a reactive one sparked by some sort of catalyst. Unfortunately, the planet does not manifest the sort of global event that is devastating enough to wake millions of people into action. Only when the planet is going haywire and we realize that our society is crumbling will we change our ways. I don't think that we as society, specially with the older generation still having power are able to give up all of these commodities on our own. I think that we will eventually be forced to switch to a plant based diet due to lack of food and we will eventually be forced to switch to renewable due to lack of oil, and so on. I have no doubt in my mind that we will adapt and survive this climate crisis, but I am fearful that all of the progress we have made in the last couple of centuries will be all but gone.
<br><hr>
It is certainly a shame that the boomer generation did not take immediate action regarding climate change, and it is worse that even with all these disasters happening, most of them are still sticking to their original goals of earning profit at the expense of all other consequences. I like how you said that if the older generation were more aware of the issue; we might be living in a more carefree world without the danger of climate change outside our door. But instead, it is up to us to fix the issue that the older generation has done to the earth. This time, we will not squander the knowledge we have received, and we will utilize this power with our full potential in helping our planet. We will need to face the wrongdoings of our previous generations and provide a more persistent and stable life for the next.
<br><hr>
When I was watching Ken’s lecture videos, the quote “If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered" spoke volumes to me as well. At the end of the day, knowledge is not power until we act on that knowledge. Jason is right, it is unbelievable how long this planet has taken to take action and save the planet. In the lecture video, Ken stated: “so, even though many Americans had not heard of global warming 50 years ago, nearly everyone knew that we needed to stop burning fossil fuels and switch to renewable energy – and knew that we needed to do so quickly.” This quote just shows how ignorant we have been. We have known about the dangers and harm that we have been doing, yet we still have taken little to no action. If we changed our ways of living 50 years ago, the planet would be in a much better state right now. However, we must stay optimistic. We have to realize that it is not too late, but we need to start now. Ken recommended us five different things that we can do to reduce our ecological footprint. I, for one, am going to try my best to lessen my beef intake.
<br><hr>
I agree that all we can do now is to move forward with the knowledge we've gained. We should have done a great many things differently along the way, but we didn't. It's easy to blame our parents and grandparents but we've all benefited from it. All we can do at this point is move forward and do our best to fix the problem. And the only reason we're able to do that is because we know how we messed it up in the first place, now all we have to do is act on the knowledge accrued.
  <br><br>
One of my favorite quotes is "if you don't know your history you are doomed to repeat it." We know that older generations chose not to act even when this information was widely available decades ago and now we know it to be true and we can see it happening so we must act now and not make the same mistakes that previous generations have.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you that if a change is going to happen it needs to start immediately.  The new generation doesn't have the luxury to wait another 60 years.  By that time it will already be too late.  The quote you highlighted from Chuck, " If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered " illustrates perfectly the world we live in right now.  We have had the knowledge for years now right at our fingertips yet many people refuse to acknowledge and change any part of their daily lives to save our planet.  I come from a republican town in the Central Valley and my family is one of the few that actually do our best to be ecofriendly.  I had many friends that knew many of the facts of climate change such as the 97% consensus and what the world would be like in the next 50 years.  Yet the would still refuse to say it was an issue even while knowing these facts because it is easier to believe that there isn't a problem and we don't need to change.  My hope is that with the knowledge this class gives I can actually turn that knowledge that was bestowed upon me into power.  Even if the power is to just change a couple people's minds about climate change for them to start making an effort to combat the climate crisis,  that is fine by me.
    <br><br>
                    I think the question raised about what present-day would look if we built our cities from scratch as a renewable energy source is an interesting one.  The Climate Crisis would most likely be a nonexistent issue and the new generation would have an amazing base to continue the eco-friendly civilization our predecessors built for us.  Instead, we are the ones that have to take the load of this, but far too late.  It is like we are in a race with the rising temp to the finish line, but the previous generation let The Climate Crisis have a free lap and is STILL cheering it on.  Change can start now, but only if the new generation turns the knowledge given to us into power


<br><hr>
Good points, I agree with the fact that we can't change the past. "If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered" has to be one of my new favorite quotes because it goes against the highly used saying of "knowledge is power." Yes, you may know certain things like what it takes to stop climate change. But it's not enough to just recite that knowledge somewhere else or just keep it in your mind for only you to know. Like Ken emphasizes, not doing anything with that knowledge helps absolutely no one. What could've been is something that we should keep in mind. It's crazy to think that the Boomer generation knew this the whole time but didn't think twice about it; all that time has gone to waste, and now we're much further back than we could've been. But what could've been, at the same time, is not a reason for us to focus our energy on the imaginary. The reality of our planet is in our hands, and like you said, we can't rewrite history. We have to keep moving forward with the perspective of what could've been as a goal of what can be. Just because things did not go a certain way to begin with doesn't mean that they can't end up like that. Also, what I think is highly important to remember is that now we have this knowledge. We have the knowledge that the Boomer generation had this knowledge but didn't act upon it. So, now if we are going to not squander our power, we have to utilize this knowledge that this previous generation messed up and act upon it. To keep it in our minds would be doing our generation a disservice.
<br><hr>
Such beautifully worded statements, I commend you. You're so right in the idea of how so many generations have squandered so much power. Honestly, these corporations probably could have even had more power at their expense had they worked with a renewable economy, had they saved their stores of fossil fuels and rationed them more effectively. Clearly, deniers don't have the knowledge that our generation, the environmentalists, have in order to make a change. We must make something of the knowledge, change our lifestyles, and just become overall better allies to the planet we've been born to.

<br><hr>
I found myself repeating the same words you highlighted from Ken’s lecture in my head after the video ended. I had never truly thought about what it meant when people would stress that “knowledge is power,” but now I realize how lacking the statement is. He’s right—just because we know how negatively our actions are impacting the earth doesn’t mean we actually have any power. In reality, it’s only if we take actual steps to address the issue of climate change would we be able to call it “power.” 
    <br><br>


It struck me by surprise that a scientist was concerned about atmospheric CO2 levels in 1854. That was 166 years ago. Yet there are people in this world who believe we should doubt the existence of climate change. It angers me to think that people can be so ignorant.
    <br><br>


On a more positive note, I really appreciated Ken listing out ways we as citizens can work to fight climate change. As you said, the changes he suggests we make to our lives are not easy ones, but if we really tried to implement them in our lives, it would be only a matter of time before we adjusted. I absolutely agree that the knowledge and power is in our hands, and we should take that knowledge and turn it into power starting today.

<br><hr>
The way you started your comment exactly explains how when Hiltner said his quote about knowledge and power. I also agree when you talked about how different our lives might be right now In a previous class I learned that many people including the USA government and its public knew about the consequences of the climate crisis so I had the same thought that maybe my life and generation might be facing a different future because in the past we used the knowledge that we had about the climate crisis and put into action the practices we needed to save our planet. But we did not and now we have to use professor Hiltner’s call to action and actually use the knowledge that we possess and be the generation to stop using fossil fuels and start combatting the consequences of the climate crisis. So at an individual level, we have to do things to change our consumption of fossil fuels, but we also need to use our knowledge and push our government into action because we need to save our planet for future generations.

<br><hr>
Completely agree. I feel that while Ken is teaching us that knowledge without application is worthless in the scope of climate change, I feel that this notion can be applied to many aspects of life; it is reflective of the fact that actions speak louder than words but in this case, louder than knowledge. This class has so far,  provided us students with so much information, insight and practical applications that we can actually put into practice to make a difference in this world. In our planet. However, if we do not share what we know or live by example, then we are just hypocrites.
  <br><br>

I feel like this lecture embodies the idea that Wang Yangming dictated in his quote, "To know and not to do is not to know.” We need to make sure that we are spreading awareness on the topic of anthropogenic climate change; we as students, I feel have learned so much over the course of only three weeks. The effects are here now, and ongoing, and if we do not do our part, our responsibility as habitants of this place that we call home, we will go down as the most selfish, inconsiderate and entitled species, more specifically generation of all time.
<br><hr>
Without any action, knowledge is not powerful! I strongly believe in this because we can learn and be educated on so many aspects of global warming and learn the ways to help decrease the emission of greenhouse gases but still fail to act because we either don't think one individual will make any difference or we are too comfortable with our current lifestyle that we don't want to adjust to change. Maybe it's both of these excuses, but we need to act now and embrace that we can change this climate crisis. Like, professor Ken mentioned it takes only five things to protect the environment and decrease your carbon footprint by almost half by just contributing to these five things. 
  <br><br>

The problem though is that many people are too used to their current lifestyle and luxuries that it will be very hard for these people to downgrade to a smaller house, or transportation by bike or bus. Also, previous generations have the idea of living and striving for the American dream and have taught future generations the same concept. Therefore, this makes it very complicated and hard for Americans to avoid this type of lifestyle because they believe that if they worked hard and have a good amount of wealth then they should be living the American dream. However, I think we should all start by taking action on what we can and feel comfortable with doing without feeling forced to do because some action is always better than no action. The idea is to start now!

Talking about the emission of CO2, I have read an article called Moral Vegetarianism from a Very Broad Basis, because of my Phil 4 class. The main thesis of the author is anyone who has access to healthy alternatives should avoid eating meats, not only because of immoral reasons, like animals have at least some moral status, but also largely because of the environmental reasons of animal raising and meat consumption. Also, I have watched a documentary “Cowspiracy” (really recommended), which mainly introduced the so large amount of CO2 that was released from the process of raising animals, feeding them and making them to the meat that we can eat. I was shocked after watching this documentary. Since I never thought that 80% of rainforest which will absorb CO2 was destroyed for cattle and 1100 activists were gunned down to speak out against cattle ranching in the last 20 years in Brazil. My response is emotional since I wasn’t aware of how serious the effects are, which leads me to think about whether should I be a vegetarian from now on. Since raising animals greatly causes the deforestation, and if trees are not efficiently enough to offer the O2 that we need to live and absorb the CO2 that leads to global warming, our planet and ourselves may be destroyed. In addition, fossil fuels also play an important role, we can’t make a change of the things that have already happened, like the English Industrial Revolution, or the !970s Manufacturing Ages. So, what we will do next is so important, I am actually optimistic about the future, since we are now encouraging to use subways, bikes, bus or electric cars instead if private cars, and I believe if more people can realize this, the requirement of fossil fuels will be drop greatly.

I found the two lecture videos to be extremely refreshing compared to the content of the reading and film that we had this week. It was nice to finally hear something factual regarding the occurring climate crisis. I did not know that people around the world realized so early that fossil fuels would become such an intense problem for our society, but I am glad that Ken has taken the time to talk about the history behind people's thought about the issue. I agree with Ken that it is crucial for us the learn about this part of the climate crisis: it will help our generation learn from the mistakes that his generation has made. 

    <br><br>

I found what Ken said about knowledge and power to be extremely eye opening. I had never thought about he idea of "knowledge is power" that way, and I completely agree with his reinterpretation of it. I get the sense that his idea of "knowledge is power, but only if you act on it" is the driving force as to why he teaches this class. I enjoy the fact that we are not just learning about the climate change but finding what we can do to help and/or fix it. While it is important to know what causes the rises in temperatures, we should also know how to combat the growing problem if we have any chance of saving our planet. 

    <br><br>

In regard to the older generation's responses to the solutions, I understand where they are coming from. To have worked your whole life to finally get what you have dreamed about your whole life is extremely hard to give up; however, with something this extreme, we must be willing to sacrifice or else we will never achieve our goal. I have faith that in the coming years, the climate crisis will become real enough, and the generation that denies climate change will be forced to  take action with the rest of the world.

This week's lectures were eye opening. This lecture in particular also upset me. It is very disappointing to know that much of the problems where already known years ago, and no one did anything to stop it. In particular I am very upset that it was known that eating meat was problematic for the environment. Like Ken mentioned, the idea of a largely plant based diets were largely laughed at. I have experienced this in one of my family gatherings. At the time my cousins had been vegetarians for a couple of years, and they were often mocked and laughed at. At the time, I did not know about all the problems about meat production, but I still felt bad for them. Once I took English 22, and watched some other movies to further get to know just how disgusting the beef industry is, I just felt an even greater anger remembering about how they mocked them. I am happy that I took some action on the knowledge I gained and decided to change to change how much meat I consume. Even seeing the steak that appeared in the video made me want to vomit.

This was a very fascinating lecture, and it touched upon so many things that I never realized. I'm glad Ken mentioned Eunice Foote, because there is an exhibition dedicated to her work in the library, and I have looked at it many times, and it always makes more sense each time. It's a shame that no one paid attention to her claims earlier, presumably because she was a woman in the mid-1800s. I thought the negative impacts of fossil fuel use and meat production were only recent discoveries, but I was surprised to see how people in the 1970s would agree that those were things we needed to reduce our consumption of. . Thinking of why people's beliefs shifted, I could only come up with one conclusion: because they were no longer being affected personally. As Ken mentions, US oil production decreased in the 70s and prices for gas skyrocketed. People felt the effect that extreme reliance on fossil fuels for energy was having, and they knew they had to change their ways. But there are no longer problems like that - at least not in the US, so the older generation has forgotten what they were worried about. Even when two leaders of the free world - Jimmy Carter and Lyndon B Johnson - tried to get people to act, they did not.
    <br><br>

I also liked the point Ken made about knowledge being power. It is true that all the knowledge in the world is useless if you don't act upon it. It is up to our generation to understand climate change and its dangers, and to act upon that knowledge and prevent things from escalating. In recent news, the science and security board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the metaphorical Doomsday Clock within 100 seconds to midnight, citing "a growing number of disasters linked to global climate change resulting from the continued consumption of fossil fuels" as one of the factors. We have to act fast. The clock has never been so close. Not even when we were on the brink of nuclear war. There are 100 seconds to midnight.

Ken’s lecture is yet another educational opportunity for us to know what we can do to reduce our own carbon footprint as an individual. There are two points that I had never thought about are having smaller housing and less children. I come from the suburbs of Atlanta, where there are neighborhoods of giant houses, and some even are enormous like a castle, and it is impossible for someone to go anywhere without a motor vehicle. Due to the fact that everyone or households own a car, public transportation system was very underdeveloped in my county, as it was only few people’s options. This might sound like a contemptuous lifestyle, but now as I’m looking back at it, it does contribute a lot to our carbon footprint.
    <br><br>

Meanwhile, I believe that the root of people’s refusal to adapt their lifestyle for a better future is, just like ken mentioned, the culture of consumerism and people’s perceived justification of their hard work. Part of the American culture includes our perceived justification for “you get what you deserve”. If you work hard, you get paid well, and vice versa. And people believe they are entitled to all their possessions. Yes, indeed, we deserve everything we had worked very hard for. But at the same time, we need to start thinking about the bigger picture here. It is the future of tomorrow that we have to put on the priority to worry about, and we need to see what’s important and start acting now. Our generation and the one afterwards would be the ones affected most directly by climate change. I like how Ken emphasized on “Knowledge is power, but it’s wasted if we don’t make good use out of it.” Therefore, before we start spreading these words, we need to put these practices into action and incorporate them into our daily life.

I appreciate Ken’s video on what we can do to help because it takes a very overwhelming problem and makes it very manageable. I think the top two things that most people would be against are giving up a car and meat and dairy. I recently went vegan and am here to tell you it's not only easier than you think, but makes you feel amazing. In terms of transportation, yes, it is a sacrifice. However, giving up a car and taking public transportation is a sacrifice that is not hard to make and can even be significantly more cost effective. The second video was more frustrating to watch. Knowing so many powerful people knew what they were doing and continued doing for their own person gain makes this crisis that much more frustrating to deal with. However, we cannot dwell on it. It is what it is and all we can do is make the appropriate sacrifices and changes to our lifestyle to counteract the problem. What cannot keep happening is allowing tycoons and skeptics to continue on their current trajectory. They have done enough damage with their “skepticism” and need to face up to the issue that they have caused and do what they can to fix it. They have gotten away with it long enough and the least they can do is not actively make the problem worse and attack the people trying to clean up their mess.

Ken is correct that "the world is depleting oil". The world is draining the oil constantly and in a larger amount. More population, more cars, more demand on oil. But oil is a limited resource, we are getting less and less oil every year. He uses the gas price as a data reference for the decrease of oil resources. I am glad from 1950 to 2020, more and more people are thinking about the climate crisis. People care more about the climate, because of knowledge. Of course, the solar panels on the White House is also a great example to the citizens. Knowledge is our key to save our earth, also our way of managing our power. People can save the world in many ways: science, politics, education, etc. I think people generally underestimate their power. A different way of commuting, from car to bus. This is not a small event, but very powerful. You can influence and alter others who are surrounding you. They may switch their lifestyles or adapt your ways of thinking. When all the people are working together, the power is gigantic. Do not wait to action when there is no fossil fuel. Switching our gear to a better and more environmentally friendly way of living. It is our responsibility to utilize our knowledge, our power, our earth. It is never too late to start changing, until that day.

First of all, you have a very cool name. Second, I'd like to build off of the point you made about the depletion of oil as a limited resource. I think that knowledge represents a potential power, and that inaction isn't the only wrong route to take when there's knowledge on a topic. You can take a form of action that is even worse than doing nothing, which is promoting actions that completely counteract the positive change that knowledge can make. For example, people knew that there was going to be an oil shortage. They squandered their power by ignoring it, causing us to have an economy that is built on foreign oil today. Today, those in power are taking it to another level by not only ignoring the existence of the truth, but attempting to twist it into something else completely and making enormous efforts to make sure people commit actions that oppose the truth. Nothing lasts forever. It's probably the greatest example of the hot hand fallacy out in the world right now. The chance of success is zero. Either climate change is going to get so bad that we are forced to switch to renewables or there will be an international economic crisis due to lack of oil and increasing demand. This economy is on bought time, and the chances of not being prepared when it runs out increase by the year.

After watching this lecture video, one thing that surprised me was that there was someone who actually thought about the relationship between the increasing level of atmospheric CO2 and global temperature rise as early as 1854. I also agree with Ken totally when he said “Knowledge is not power, not by a long shot… For it to become power, we must act on knowledge.” Those who did not know about climate change (or global warming, what it was called back then), certainly would not give action, but for those who did know (more than those who don’t), ignorance would not be tolerated. 
    <br><br>

Like how Ken suggested in this video, if you really want to do something to contribute to the current situation, there’s plenty of things for you to start. For example, although I am not a vegetarian or vegan, I have been working on my diet for quite a long time, this includes reducing the amount of meat I eat weekly while adding more “green foods” such as tomatoes and fruits, transportation is another way.

I completely agree with the phrase ken said, Knowledge gives people the ability to have power but power is present by action. Unfortunately, many of us- including myself included have do not always utilize our power. Ignorance implies that people willingly remain to stay uninformed and that is one of the main reasons why people do not respond or attempt to acknowledge climate change. What makes things even crazier for me is that there are people actively denying science, how is it possible for people to legitimately ignore and refute known facts??? 
    <br><br>

I also liked that you included friendly alternative ways that one can improve even if it is slight improvement. Not one human can change the world but collectively we can improve. By just spending one day without meat then this alters the supply and demand curve for meat in general or even switching to alternatives. Yes, it would be better to be vegetarian or vegan but similarly small steps make a big difference as well. Substitute your milk with almond milk, eat chicken instead of cow for dinner, or even take the train home instead of driving by yourself.
<br><hr>

I was also seriously surprised that the relationship between CO2 and temperature rise had been formulated back in the 19th century. Ken does a great job of laying out how there has consistently been an ample supply of evidence for the danger of fossil fuel burning and environmental destruction. However, public policy has not reflected the change in public knowledge. Despite the fact that humans have been well aware of the presence of a crisis, little action has been taken. Our Earth is only getting more dangerous and inhospitable, and the threat of climate collapse seems more and more present every day. The issue is not with knowledge, but with the way that we can collectively listen to the warnings and attempt to make a change
    <br><br>

We all know that a solution to climate change will have to involve a collective effort by a massive amount of human beings. However, I sometimes think that the way the blame is put on average citizens might be unfair. We can talk about the fact that we "knew" when climate change was coming, but unless the information is publically dispersed through a mode such as education, the public will never find out about it. I also think that it might be somewhat misguided to think that the climate crisis will be solved through the small actions of many individuals. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with small acts of service, we need a systemic change. The people in power, who are deeply tied to expensive financial interests, have a much larger role to play in addressing the climate crisis. The acts of the individual should be to show their elected representatives that the climate crisis is an issue that people care about.

Watching "Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do" highlighted 5 options that we can do to cut back on our carbon footprint by fifty percent. Eliminating transportation from cars to buses and bikes seem reasonable but to some it isn't. Switching over to a plant-based diet has a lot of advantages like a better overall diet and cutting our carbon footprint. Living in the city is more desirable nowadays and having a smaller family is already being seen today.  Also, there are already businesses that re-use clothes and make them into a more modern look. These changes seem reasonable to some but for everyone to do it isn't realistic. People have lived their lives for so long that any change or compromise is not possible. In the video "what the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis" ken mentioned that they knew of the problem 60 years ago. The transition could have been possible if the older generations started the change. Now it is up to our generation to follow these guides and teach the next generation, so that we do not make the same mistake.

I agree that it may be difficult for the older generation to change the way they have lived for decades, but it is necessary. From what I have seen from comments by older people online and in real life, many believe that the things many people are starting to implement in their daily lives to cut back on our carbon footprint, such as veganism and thrifting, are just trends started by young people that will eventually die out. I think it's great that these things are beginning to trend, and it's now "cool" to thrift or it's "cool" to eat locally. This means that more and more young people will follow along, and hopefully many will become more educated on why these things are good for the environment.

After watching these lectures, I have learned so much and I also have more hope for a better future. To be honest I think that changing transportation from driving a car to driving a bicycle is a great idea. First, we all save a lot of money and we will all have a healthier life since we will be more active which is beneficial to our body. Subsequently, a plant-based diet could enhance our health by giving us even more strength. I think that even buying pre-owned clothing is beneficial to our psychological health since it will help us understand how to value things more. In regards to having kids, well I think that most actually want 1 or 2 kids. Then again 1 kid or zero kids saves a lot of money. These solutions are reasonable but most of us will probably no adapt to them. I know for sure my parents would not want to live in such a way especially if they won’t eat meat anymore. But I feel that even though life will seem hard at first, in the end everyone will fully adapt and appreciate the change they have made.
    <br><br>
I am now very motivated to start these changes. I know I will have a hard time since very few of us will unite to help promote these solutions. But thanks to Ken’s lectures, I have a lot of hope that we will all open our eyes soon.

I really appreciate your positivity. When I took English 22 with Ken, I had the same positive attitude and even change my diet. I became a vegetarian and only ate meat when I would go back home since eating meat is a huge part of my culture. Now, I continue to do the same and although I get so much negative comments from family and friends back home about my diet change because I look too “unhealthy” and sound like such a “college student” I know what I know, and I will continue to act upon what I have learned to help the environment. I have convinced my parents to try meals without meats a couple of times and to me that is an accomplishment. It’s the little things that count. However, as you stated many will not adapt to these changes to better of the environment no matter the knowledge they gain. Like Ken stated, his generation knew that eating meat, fossil fuels, etc. and yet nothing was done. Despite the changes we can make that are doable for some, I feel scared to think that people will still not take any type of accountability and act. The fact people that are rich and celebrities live "bigger"  and do not downsize at all yet people that are low-income suffer the consequences of climate crisis. Things like that are frustrating because we are all talking about taking action to make the environment better, but most rich folks are living so big that they do not care about their carbon footprint in all aspects yet they have all the tools to make an impact.

After watching this film, I started getting to know that how we can do to reduce carbon dioxide. As Ken has mentioned, "If acted on, knowledge is power. If not, knowledge is power squander." I strongly agreed with what he has said. In other words, if we understand the importance and know everything that could improve our environment but we never take action to do so, it is worthless. It means nothing. Therefore, it is necessary for us to really do something to stop producing fossil fuels and emissions that may cause the climate crisis. 
    <br><br>

We should also try to eat less meat and lean toward more to veganism. It is also a great way to make our homeland a better place.

I think that the fact that no consequences could be viewed from this generations actions really caused them to not take action. I think that if this generation, the boomer generation, was able to see the changes occurring from their actions, they would have taken this issue more seriously. Since they were not able to see these changes, they did not take this problem seriously enough. Yet they definitely still could have taken action as many people knew that consequences of consuming an abundance of meat and using fossil fuels would cause harm. Even the president, Jimmy Carter, was aware of the problems occurring from these actions and decided to put solar panels on the roof of the white house, but after there was a shift in power America reverted back to American's old ways of not caring about the consequences of climate change. I think that if I was in their position I probably would have consumed as much and ate as much meat as them. I believe this problem is more situational than generational, as culture is a result of time and place, and thoughts were very much different in that time period. But now this boomer generation sees the consequences and still does not act which is the reason that they should take more of the blame and why our generation needs to step up. Everybody on this planet should take climate change as a serious problem and it needs to be acted on right now before the world is destroyed.

After watching the videos, I felt as if I've heard the same lectures over and over again. Don't get me wrong, they are great words of advice but as someone who has a plant based diet and doesn't succumb to fast fashion, I just wish there were more immediate things we can do. I guess a step I can now take would be sharing the sustainable lifestyle with as many people as I can. Like Ken said, "If acted upon, knowledge is power. If not, knowledge is power squandered." Being in this class alone, we as students are exposed to so many different aspects of this climate crisis and the facts, we should be telling everyone we know and also the solutions that are here right now. 
    <br><br>
In the video Ken talks about how every change in someone's lifestyle makes a huge impact on the world and if every meat eater understood how the production of meat hurt the world and really listened, I think it'd make a difference. Humans have to make connections and have emotional understanding of one another to really make a difference.
    <br><br>
I also find it crazy that for over a century scientists have known CO2 was bad for the atmosphere and nothing has changed. People in the 70s or 80s knew eating meat and polluting the air was bad but still did close to nothing. At this point in the 21st century, people do not have an excuse to not know about the climate crisis, they just choose to ignore it because "out of sight, out of mind." I really hope my generation  makes the difference our planet needs and learns from past mistakes.

I have lived on a mainly plant-based diet for the past 8 years and I too wish there were more immediate actions that I could take in order to help our environment. I think this week was especially important in terms of leaving the different things that we can do to help the climate as well as learning about the stances of the people who deny that our climate is changing at all, much less as rapidly as it is.  It's crazy to me how much even just taking beef out of your diet can help the environment. Cows take up so much land and with their methane farts, they are only harming the environment. Over the years, I feel like I have helped do my part in limiting the amount of beef that my friends and family eat simply because of my own decisions. 
    <br><br>


I'm truly happy that I am able to take this course and work to spread everything that I learn to the people who are close to me so that I can help make more of an impact. My grandmother has explicitly told me before that she doesn't believe that the temperature increase that we have seen over the past decades is nothing to worry about and everyone makes too big of a deal about the climate. This has never really irritated me until I started taking this class and started to learn the facts about what is going on and how dire the situation is and the need for us to all act. 
    <br><br>


I agree with you that the main thing we can all do right now is to share the knowledge that we have received in this class, with everyone that we know and start to diminish the belief of the climate crisis being a "hoax."

Knowledge is power, as Professor Hiltner said, is false, but I disagree with this statement to a certain extent. It is mainly due to the way we define power. What is power? Power to make a change, power to control, power to influence? There are many definitions of power, but ultimately, I believe it is a combination of everything. Forbes said that President Vladimir Putin is one of the most powerful men in the world, and many people would agree with that statement, he has a lot of power as well as knowledge. He knows a lot about the political situation in Russia as well as the world. Also, regarding President Donald Trump, he certainly has a lot of power, but many would disagree with the fact that he has adequate knowledge in comparison to his predecessors. But I believe that he also has quite a lot of knowledge in manipulating his supporters as well as exploiting people to obtain his objectives. So, I believe that knowledge is power, but it is only a matter of how that knowledge is used. People like Professor Hiltner has knowledge as well as power to influence, thus he is using his power to influence the rest of us to make a change to the world. 
    <br><br>
Regarding how our generation could make a change to climate change, the solution that the professor has provided us are easy to some but could also provide a challenge to certain people. It also requires collective effort to achieve this goal. I would attempt my best to limit my carbon footprint and diet habits, but for many others, either due to locational or economic conditions, they might not be able to help out as much. Could there be any other ways that we can contribute to the resolving issue of climate change?

Videos 3 and 4 in this series really made me realize that climate change deniers are not necessarily against action on this issue, but they are against their freedoms being taken away, which I completely understand. People see America as a place where they can accomplish goals and do anything their heart desires with almost no limitations. "It's a free country" is a mantra that a lot of people hold on to. To some people, it is preposterous to ask of them to transition to a plant-based diet or to ask them to consume less. They believe that they earned the right to consume as much as they want based on the hard work they put in to be in that position.

    <br><br>

While I do agree with their sentiments, I also think that with that right to consumption comes the responsibility to make the planet a better place for the next generation. People of older generations have taught us throughout our childhood to leave places better than we found them. However, it is evident they are not practicing what they preach. By consuming such a large amount of beef, driving large, gas-guzzling vehicles, and requiring ridiculously large houses, everyone is responsible for what is happening now and what will continue to happen. I am thankful for all that I have, and I can't imagine a life without it, but I feel bad for the next generation, our children, who will have to live with less "stuff", whether by choice or by necessity, than their parents.

We’ve heard for months maybe years that it is my generation that will reduce climate change. This is a lot of pressure put on people that don’t even have a master's degree yet. It's scary to think that it is up to me and my peers, but at the same time, it gives me hope. We actually know that our actions are causing a big impact on the earth. The generations before us only wanted to focus on how they could run out of fuel to make their materialistic wants. They were only worried about how oil will eventually run out and they would have to find another resource. They knew they had a problem before they could see the whole picture. I think this is why many refuse to believe what we are telling them. They don’t want to hear something that's worse than they already thought. The global impact of climate change shouldn’t have been put in the hands of teenagers who want to live great lives and have nice cars. The impacts could have been reduced if they would have paid more attention and published it more. Everyone knows recycling is good for the planet because it keeps trash out of the oceans, but not everyone is aware of the unsustainable impacts of eating meat. Meat should have labels that compare the number of carbon forms to be produced compared to the number of lentils that could have been produced. 
    <br><br>

Propaganda is a huge part of why my generation is more motivated. On social media, we see pictures of turtles being trapped in plastic and covered in oil. It uses high amounts of pathos to motivate us to stop using straws. This is similar to older generations, except now we have climate change, which is affected by all of the things that were known about in the past. It is selfish to put all of the stress on the next generations just because they didn’t want to put down a steak. This isn’t about politics and who’s a “libtard” anymore. This is real and its extremely stupid to ignore it.

After watching “Climate of Doubt”, I feel really confused that 97-99 percents of scientists have said that the global warming was caused by human activities. Why do we still have problem in that? Why is there still some percentages of scientist still misunderstanding? In order to develop new technology and industries, people put lots of green house gases into the atmosphere. Compared to the period of time that global warming is not serious, we have had so many industries and factories during that time. As we can see, this is an evidence to show that human activities cause the global warming. We should face the problem directly but not try to find other excuse.

Excuses are a way out. It is a sad truth but a majority of our population is widely uneducated and consistently falls privy to loads of misinformation at our fingertips. We live in a world of specialists and with that comes those who specialize in what we would consider the "wrong" thing. People make tons of money pushing other's agendas and manipulating the votes and minds of the masses. Money carries tremendous weight and major corporations will do whatever necessary to ensure their place and wealth in the world. As Ken said, "if not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered", and it is the responsibility of the public to make sense of what we are presented and make decisions and changes in our lifestyle based on what that is. We should use what we've seen as what not to do and use this to ignite the change that we need to see within our own world.


<br><hr>

Yeah i agree, who are these 1-3% of scientists that still don’t believe in global warming? I bet they’re not scientists at all, or possibly social scientists... one of my favorite talking points is that, like you said, to develop new technologies emits carbon too. even to make a solar panel or wind turbine. the answer is to simply use less energy and live simpler lives, which is never going to happen at least in the US.

<p>
You have taught me something - knowledge is worthless if it is not acted upon. You can learn how to fix your car but if you never do it then that knowledge is wasted. Likewise, the people who knew about the climate crisis but didn't act have caused future generations to suffer the consequences. Learning about the 1970s energy crisis was interesting. I think it's better to rely on renewable energy than rely on oil from other countries. If we become too dependent on other countries, we become weak and can be crippled easily. 
    <br><br>

I disagree with some of your points in your other video. If you live in a city, it is easy to use public transportation and live in a small apartment because it's cheaper. But many people live in rural places far from cities. These people must commute to work in cars since buses are nonexistent. Cars are also a way of life for most Americans and a symbol of freedom and independence. It will be hard for me to abandon cars. I also love meat so I probably will never become a vegetarian. However, I agree with having less kids, buying less things, and living in smaller places. I don't like big houses because they waste too much money on heating, air conditioning, etc. I think compromise is essential to beat climate change. For example, I can choose to eat more fish and chicken instead of meat. I can also drive an electric car instead of a gasoline car. These are all small steps I can take to try to fight climate change.

The first video, which laid out five major changes we can make to solve climate change, left me feeling very defeated. The fact that these options are pretty simple just makes me even more disappointed that more people especially grown adults can't make the switch. At first my thought was that most people just don't care about the environment, other species, people developing countries, etc. but I think the reality is we don't want to change. I know that it's possible for all of us to change, so why don't we? Simply because we chose not to and we are lazy. Something I didn't think about until it as brought up in my section for ES2 was that as much as each person has an impact on climate change, there is also a systemic impact that is somewhat out of our control. I know that making all or some of the 5 options Ken talked about would make a huge difference, but there's also so much that is dictated by the government, and big businesses like oil, gas, animal agriculture. This realizations points to another way to invoke change which is voting, protesting, marching and making our voices heard all together. For so long I didn't go vegan or vegetarian because I figured that me not buying meat or eggs or dairy wouldn't make any difference. Those products would still be in the grocery store. I can proudly say today that I am vegan and I understand more about how much vegans and vegetarian life styles can actually affect the supply and demand. In addition, there have been so many plant based products showing up in restaurants and grocery stores across America and I see that as a step in the right direction. It makes the switch more accessible and popular, and this change has happened relatively quickly. Another point someone brought up in class was the political divide, that may lean towards the assumption that the Conservative party doesn't like change, being told what to do, or straying from "the American way". I think plant based eating finding it's way through fast food is a example of a compromise, because it's still promoting big business and obesity and laziness, but it's better than meat based food. I just hope this a step in the right direction and we can adapt to incorporate more and more plant based into all our lives as soon as possible.

Before watching this video, I think they did not know that their behavior would impact the environment later. However, I soon discovered that I was wrong. After watching this video, I'm really surprised that people have been aware of greenhouse gases and human impacts on the environment since the 1970s and haven't done anything to really solve this problem. This generation is aware of the environmental problems, and they know they caused them, but they still haven't changed anything. In fact, they're not even trying to stay the same, they're just making things worse. The concept of global warming was first proposed in 1854. Eunice Foote who is a women scientist has made it clear that increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will cause global temperatures to rise. But no one listened, maybe they listened, just didn't believe her, or didn't care, because it wasn't a problem for their lives at that time. However, today the climate crisis has become a serious problem that we face. Now the situation of environmental problems is serious and urgent, we must make efforts now. At the same time, older generations need to recognize the serious consequences of the climate crisis and work together to address it. Ken says at the end of the video, "knowledge is power only acted upon, otherwise knowledge is power squander." Yes, when we do not use our knowledge to do the right thing, we just waste our knowledge.

I think Ken's caption for this lecture video itself really caught my attention right away--especially "...and when we knew it". This lecture video confirmed my suspicions that individuals from the boomer generations knew and have known what they were doing. (Maybe not at first, but the boomer generation definitely has caught on). I noticed that a handful of individuals I know from this generation will acknowledge the climate crisis (though most deny it), but they often respond with something along the lines of "well, it's done, what can we do?" This brings me to my next point, you mentioned how at the end of this video, Ken says "Knowledge is power only acted upon, otherwise knowledge is power squander." I think this is a very powerful quote mainly because I feel that older generations tend to look down upon younger generations when it comes to topics dealing with climate change due to the societal idea that "older people are wiser". While this is true in some cases, I feel that yes, these older generations have the knowledge and do know what is happening to our planet, but because they choose to do nothing, that knowledge turns to a waste".
    <br><br>

Next, in response to your response, I want to highlight a specific quote, "This generation is aware of the environmental problems, and they know they caused them, but they still haven't changed anything. In fact, they're not even trying to stay the same, they're just making things worse." This statement strongly resonated with me because I have had this thought so many times!! The boomer generation truly embodies "ignorance is bliss" by actively ignoring the climate crisis despite being a huge part of it. 
    <br><br>

All in all, to me I feel that Ken has repeatedly talked about the older generation and their ignorance, and I feel as if the younger generations are the ones acting against the climate crisis and actively changing their ways. So perhaps, Ken should focus a bit more on how we can convince/implement change in the older generations? Just a thought!

After watching the lecture videos, I think these five ways are possible for me. Since I'm taking school, I can only live in an apartment and take the bus. For the other strategies, eating less meat and buy fewer things are not problems for me. If these simple things can have a huge impact on climate, I think everyone should do it. They're not things that seem impossible for everyone. If we try, everything is possible. Only by doing them can make the climate better, I think it's not a big deal for eating less meat, living with others.

“If acted upon, knowledge is power; if not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered”. I totally agree with this sentence. We have gained some knowledge about the climate crisis and possible solutions to mitigate the severe issue, but we need to actually utilize it and take action to achieve goals and save our planet. Ken proposed five solutions that could help solve the problem of climate change and global warming and I believe that these five methods are reasonable and workable. As he mentioned, it does not mean that people should live in a very small house or even share a home with others. Living in a city is good for less car use and more efficient housing. Changing habits to a plant-based diet will not only help reduce the waste of food but also establish a healthy lifestyle. All of these could benefit our earth, climate, and species, as well as on ourselves. Isn’t that appealing to you? For me, I will try my best to follow these actions and make efforts to protect our Earth.

    <br><br>



Moreover, Ken mentioned that the older generation, in fact, has a thorough understanding of climate change and the possible catastrophe that the increased burning of fossil fuels may bring, but they just ignore it and continue to do so. The beliefs they hold will have dramatic influences on the future generation due to the delayed effects of the climate crisis. That’s why they don’t want to change their beliefs and actions. It’s a problem, but the most important thing is that we should take action and do it now. The situation is severe and urgent, we need to make efforts now and it is not time to wait. I hope that the older generation could realize the serious consequences of the climate crisis one day and work together to fix the issue.

I agree. After learning about the easy five personal changes I can make to reduce climate change, and hearing Ken's quote about "knowledge is power if acted upon," I want to act. It's convenient that it is already "cool" to be environmentally conscious, and that these lifestyle changes, such as plant-based diet, thrift shopping, using public transportation, and living in cities is already trending. It's also cheaper, in my opinion. It also feel kinda gross to not do those things, for example, when I use a car when I could be walking or busing. It just feels like such as waste of CO2 emissions. I think if this feeling spreads to other people, changes could be easier. 

    <br><br>

It's nice that activists now aren't being ostracized as they did back in the 70's. I wonder why they were being made fun of. I guess people back then were just adamant in keeping their "freedom" and harmful lifestyle. It's also so interesting to learn that Eunice Foote knew in 1854 that CO2 rise would lead to temperature rise. 
    <br><br>


Another thing: it seems like energy crisises lead to a rush towards renewable energy. Back then, in the '70s, shift toward renewables seem to be economically driven. Isn't gas super expensive now? Why aren't we shifting more to renewables faster? Heat pumps are 4x more efficient than gas heaters and have no CO2 or methane emissions and can be used for residential heating and cooling. It's more efficient, and will cost less in the long run. 
    <br><br>


I have a question: if people knew that, and politicians supported it, like LBJ in 1965, and Jimmy Carter in 1970 were pro reducing fossil fuel use, what caused the shift? Why are people like this now? I know they failed to act on it. Has it only been on the backburner until Obama did cap and trade, and then the economic recession in 2008 galvanized the climate change deniers into action? We were on the right path, a bit slow, but on the right path.There seems to be a turn in the wrong direction.

In response to this lecture video in addition to the previous lecture video, I wash shocked by both how easy it is to adapt your everyday life to one of more sustainability and reduce your carbon footprint and by how long we have known about the climate crisis, or even just the harm of the practices that have caused the climate crisis and yet little actions has taken place over such a long period of change. After watching the first lecture video and seeing the different ways I could reduce my own carbon footprint, my reaction was one of shock at how easy it could be for me to achieve the five goals. As a younger person, I am already living in a community building, I do not own a car and use public transportation, biking, and walking to get around, and do not plan on having more than two children. The two goals I could work on would be reducing my consumerism and switching off meat to a more plant-based diet. However both of these things are very doable and I have already been pushing myself to eat less meat and when I do eat meat, having it be chicken that is less environmentally harmful than beef. After watching the second lecture video, I was shocked by how long we have known that human greenhouse emissions could cause global warming and climate change. The fact that it was first suggested in 1854 is absurd and the idea became more mainstream in the 20th century which left plenty of time for action to have been taken in the late 20th century and early 2000s. The closing statement that was made by Professor Hiltner was very powerful as he voiced how the saying “knowledge is power” is problematic because it is only half the part. We need to act on the knowledge in order to become powerful. As Hiltner puts it, “if not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered.”

Your comment resonated with me as I find that I need to address the same things in my lifestyle that you mentioned. I am more than guilty of indulging in the consumerism that dominates American culture, finding joy in material possessions that are more than unnecessary in the scheme of my life. The value placed in material goods has become so deeply ingrained in our society and I hope that I can undo some of the capitalistic conditioning that has been imprinted in me. In the future, I aim to cut back on the material things that I buy, and to shop second hand whenever I am able. In regards to my diet, I have not relied on meat as a large factor of it; however, it is present in the majority of meals that I eat. I too hope to consume less meat in general and/or eat meat that leaves a smaller carbon footprint. I was astounded when Ken relayed the fact that the production of a pound of beef has the equivalent carbon footprint to thirty pounds of lentils in their production process. This fact emphasized to me the criticality of the spread of knowledge in regards to personal changes that can be made to reduce the negative environmental impact of the average individual. I am extremely fearful for the fate of the Earth with the current climate crisis, but I feel simultaneously hopeful that the human population will take the action necessary to change the impending fate of the Earth as we utilize the tools that have been presented to us for battling to crisis in our own lives.


<br><hr>

I too share fear for the fate of the Earth as it seems like nothing is being done to combat this issue whether on a large scale policy scale or on an individual level. I however do find hope in the fate of the Earth in learning about the different ways that we as individuals can help combat climate change by making shifts in our own lifestyle. I think that in the long-run policy changes are going to be required but other than expressing our political opinions and making sure we show up at the polls, and on voting day there is nothing else we can do. It is thus important that we make these little changes in our life in order to cut our carbon footprint in half and lead by example in the world’s effort to combat climate change. And who knows, maybe if these lifestyle shifts among individuals begin to become popular it could send a message to politicians and help galvanize policy action that will address climate change more head on than what we have seen so far.

It’s hard for me to accept that the Boomer Generation knew as much as they did and that they were warned about as much as they were. It’s hard for me to fully understand how a generation knew the Earth was going down a bad path environmentally, and knew that they were causing it, and still did nothing to change. In fact they didn’t even try to remain the same, they just made it worse. Even writing this now, I’m still shocked at what I heard, but intrigued to know more. Before watching the video, I thought maybe the Boomer Generation had a good idea that what they were doing was bad, but thought there wouldn’t be consequences or that the consequences wouldn’t come for a long long time. I quickly found out, this wasn’t the case. It completely baffles me that the concept of global warming was introduced as early as 1854. Scientist Eunice Foote clearly suggested that an increase levels in atmospheric CO2 would result in global temperature rise. But no one listened, or maybe they did and just didn’t believe her or didn’t care because it wouldn’t be a problem for their lifetime. In a previous lecture during an i-clicker quiz, Ken mentioned that President LBJ was the first president to address climate change, but I wasn’t quite sure how. I knew that at the end of the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter put solar panels on the White House, but what did President LBJ do? Fortunately, this video cleared up this question for me. In 1965, President LBJ made a speech that addressed a report in the White House that dealt with “restoring the quality of our environment.” He went on to mention that within a few generations, we are burning fossil fuels to the same amount that slowly accumulated in the Earth over the past 500 million years and that the increase in CO2 will be close to 25%.
      <br><br>
      With all the hype of being vegan, I would have thought people discovered eating less meat leads to less methane pollution recently. However, it appears that this was discovered at minimum 50 years ago. In the early 1970s, many people in the US and the developed world knew that meat consumption was an environmental disaster with respect to methane. If they knew back then, why has vegan food chains and vegan options only now spreading. This is something that should’ve been addressed before now. If back then we had addressed it, maybe now we would have some fast food places with an all vegan menu. The truth is, people are more likely to get food that’s more convenient, which would be fast food, so if we placed vegan options or had a whole vegan fast food franchise, maybe then we would have more people cutting down or out meat from their diet. As a result, they would be cutting down the methane. 
      <br><br>
    The truth is even if people in the Boomer Generation weren’t familiar with the term global warming, they still were aware that they had to stop burning fossil fuels and switch to renewable energy and quickly. Even if back then they didn’t know meat production and climate change were linked, most still knew eating meat was deeply problematic environmentally. You see, they didn’t know the terminology, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that they had a lot of insight on what the outcomes would look like. I really liked what Ken said at the end of this video, “knowledge is power only when acted upon, otherwise knowledge is power squandered.” Back then they had knowledge about climate change, but because the Boomer Generation didn’t act, they squandered it. Let’s not have our knowledge squandered, let’s act!

<p>
When Ken described what the average American knew about climate change in the 1970s, I was shocked. If they knew back then that fossil fuels, and especially the production of meat, were terrible for the environment, why didn’t they limit their intake? Another question I have is, why have I known that a plant based diet was much more environmentally friendly for only a couple years? Why wasn’t I educated on this detrimental cause of climate change earlier? And then I remember the doubt that was taught in schools and confirmed by many political leaders. It seems like those in power in America (political leaders, Big Food corporations, the extremely wealthy) want to keep the causes of climate change as well as the solutions a secret. These people in power are largely benefiting off of what is destroying Earth: fossil fuels and excessive agriculture and meat consumption. From what Ken said, it seems like the Boomer generation knew all of climate change’s causes and how to mitigate it, yet little to no action was taken. This infuriates me, as it does Ken; this disaster could have been much more avoidable if the issue was taken more seriously back in the 1970s. And in saying this, I am not saying that our generation is far more superior than the Boomer generation because we are finally realizing and taking action. If any of the past generations were in the position we are in now, they would act exactly the same. Humans have a trend of caring about something mainly if it will affect them in the long run. The reason the Boomer generation didn't act is because the science showed that the major consequences of climate change wouldn't happen until after their lifetimes. And, the reason we have decided to act is because science proves that the consequences WILL be present during our lifetimes. Although it is good that we are finally acting, it just shows how the treatment and care of the Earth comes secondary for many people's priorities.

I honestly find the consumerism nature and self interest of Americans at the cost of the environment, especially the older generations, to be disgusting. People in the 1970s knew that an increase of Co2 emissions from fossil fuels could bring catastrophic devastation, yet no one cared because they did not want to change their way of life. People in our country are so caught up in money and the display of wealth. Constantly buying bigger houses, nicer cars, more clothes, etc just to show that they have money. As a younger citizen I guess it is easier to feel this way because I don’t own enough money of my own to even think about purchasing all these things. Hopefully our generation, when we become homeowners, will take into consideration the carbon footprint we have on the environment with all of our purchases and choices. The baby boomer generation had the knowledge of the direction they were headed in and were warned through things like the 1970 energy crisis, Gilbert Plass prediction of temperature rise, and Lyndon B Johnson’s call to action. However, no actions were taken because they were not directly feeling the consequences.
      <br><br>

I think the 5 things we can all do to reduce our carbon footprint significantly is not asking too much. I’d say the most difficult one is transportation, because mass transit is not always the most realistic option for people who live in areas that have minimal access to it, which requires government funding to make this transition easier. I have found that at UCSB it is easier to be sustainable due to more vegan and vegetarian food options, smaller living spaces, and walking or biking to everything. I think the point that was interesting was how it would’ve been a lot easier for our generation to already be doing these things if our parents raised us on these 5 actions. The longer one gets involved in the consumerism culture, the harder it is to break away from it, which is why I think the older generations have a harder time with this concept than younger students.

Ken has a very powerful message to share; "If acted upon, knowledge is power. If not, knowledge is power squandered."  It is astounding to me to learn that the previous generation knew that they needed to ween off fossil fuels and that ultimately the continuation of their way of life would be detrimental to the planet, yet they did nothing, and continued to live in a way they knew was not sustainable for the planet.  This seems like one of the most selfish things to do, only thinking of themselves, and not the next generation, even though we are their children.  I think that Ken's five points of, transportation, housing, food waste, limited children, and our relationship towards stuff are very attainable goals.  Living in Isla Vista, I feel like most people have already tackled the issues of transportation and housing since most people live with 6+ people and use bikes or skateboards to commute to school and the store.  I also know that there is a large composting community, (which my friends and I are a part of!!) and many think very progressively towards their relationship with stuff.  However, I think that this last goal will also be the hardest for the average American to attain because it seems like the entire generation before us built this country on the goal of attaining "things".  In short, that is what the "American Dream" seems to be.  Come to America to work and make money so that you can buy a big house and live a life of luxury.  I hope that my generation is able to see past the pursuit of material belongings and instead focus on appreciating the beauty of the world around us, especially since we don't know how much longer we will have it for.

While watching Ken’s videos I was thinking the same thing about living in Isla Vista. UCSB as a whole is very environmentally conscious and I think it’s easy for our campus to forget that the rest of our country does not have an equally sustainable way of life. I think we’re all very lucky to go to school here and spend such an impressionable part of our lives in this kind of community. I hope that we all carry this unique way of living with us throughout our adult lives. 
      <br><br>

I also strongly agree with what you said about the American Dream. The basis of this country and of what many people think of as success is making as much money as possible in order to buy as many things as possible. We cannot let this way of thinking continue and I think some fundamental shifts are necessary. I have hope for my generation in this regard because the majority of people I know aren’t overly concerned with material items and often shop at thrift stores. What makes me nervous is that a few of my peers still hold onto this idea that material possessions and huge houses equate to success. The main reason they hold onto this is because they have so much respect for their parents and want to essentially do the same thing with their own lives. While it obviously isn’t bad that they carry this respect, I hope that they are able to still achieve their dreams but in a much more sustainable way than the generations before us.

Both of these lecture videos had me thinking about the climate crisis and its damaging yet forthcoming consequences . I chose to comment on this video because the topic of knowledge caught my attention. Ken mentioned that his generation knew what they were doing, they knew that their lifestyle and demands were being fulfilled at a big risk. They had the knowledge they so desperately needed in order to have their eyes opened, yet they still managed to screw up. Their knowledge was not power. Their knowledge was not used to their advantage. They did not act even though they knew the consequences of what they were doing. Even after the country began to suffer from oil shortages and had to raise prices on goods, the American consumer refused to acknowledge the global-scale catastrophe that was being sparked. As Ken explains, if acted upon, knowledge is power. This is the only way we can defend our need for knowledge and education. If we do nothing in response to our knowledge, we may as well not have it. There is no point in knowing that our world is being destroyed if we are not doing what is in our power to change that. Even the smallest thing can have a positive impact on our world’s survival. We cannot afford to not act upon our knowledge. As a progressive generation, we need to begin to act upon our education. We can start with making the smallest change and work our way up to a healthier lifestyle, not only for ourselves as humans but for our planet as our home. As Ken mentioned in his other video, we can take matters into our own hands and begin with buying second hand items or with being more careful with what we eat and how we manage our diet/food. We cannot let our generation flop. We have to use our knowledge to our advantage and encourage those we care about to do the same.

<p>
In the first lecture video, Ken describe 5 easy way that can mitigate climate change for normal people can be available in daily life. Like living in a cozy and small house and replace automobile car. For me as an example, every day I choose to walk to school or taking the bus instead of driving car. Also, I rent an apartment and live with other 3 friends together. I try my best to minimize my personal carbon footprint. But I am not a vegetarian, I often eat a lot of meat. Maybe I can update my meal habits in order to protect the environment. Those actions are small actions that one people only do once will not have big change. However, if people around us and all do these actions for a long time. It definitely will have positive influence on global warming.
      <br><br>
And the second lecture mentions that people really do not know the severity of global warming until 1950s. People did not know before; they missed a lot of opportunities to protect the earth. Now we know that the earth can't stand our wanton destruction, so we have to protect ourselves from the beginning

The ways of reducing CO2 or methane in the atmosphere seem really straightforward and easy but it seems like we still can’t do it on a normal basis. Coming from a big city, I realized that many people do take public transportation, walk, or bike. Even at UCSB, it is known for having so many bikers on the bike path and I think instead of driving to classes, bikes and walking is a great alternative in reducing CO2 in the atmosphere. As a student, I walk everywhere at UCSB even though it seems like a hassle especially if you have class in the early morning or late night but I think the scenery really helps and if you’re walking with a friend, it also helps the time go by quicker. After realizing how simple the methods were to reduce CO2 and methane, if everyone decides to switch to a plant-based diet for at least once a week, we can significantly reduce methane and be environmentally friendly. Hearing Ken repeat that knowledge is only power if acted upon multiple times rang a bell in me because I always heard the phrase knowledge is power but when he added the part “acted upon”, it just made me think so hard about the times where people know a fact but doesn’t do anything beyond just knowing the fact. Yes, they might tell other people but if the person doesn’t do anything about it, then what’s the point of knowing that information? 
      <br><br>


Americans during Ken’s generational probably didn’t know exactly what climate change is because it wasn’t super well known then but they all knew how bad the increasing CO2 and methane concentration in the air was. I think because now it is more widely known as climate change and is more of a political issue, people from that generation can’t seem to admit they were wrong because instead of getting judgment from people they know, they’re gonna get judgment through the media or from random people. This makes them scared to voice their thoughts and I think it is a common thing that occurs. It must be hard for people at that age to admit that they were wrong to the younger generation because as an elder, they feel that they have much more knowledge than us and I think Ken did a good job of apologizing for his generation.

Learning from this video that people knew that something like the climate crisis would occur even before the CO2 levels really started to take off saddens me. If the older generations had chosen to act on their knowledge, to gain power, this video, this class, would have no reason to exist. I suppose some did act: President Carter put the solar panels on the White House (even though they were later taken down) and President Johnson addressed Congress about the issue. However, this was not public, the majority of the population, taking action. In order to see change through we need many people to have the knowledge that they can act on to become power. Sadly, we are no in this predicament. It was also saddening to hear that fossil fuel companies knew about the issue that they were causing but didn't do anything to stop it, probably because of greed. It took an oil crisis (that affected the entire country) to finally push people to move towards renewables, but even today we still use gasoline for our cars: more meddling by fossil fuel companies to secure a profit. If we are to save our planet we need to do as Ken says, take our knowledge and act on it, as a large body. Giving power to the people, the public, will help us to change policies and avoid disaster.

I found the fact that people knew about the consequences of burning fossil fuels at such an early time. I have always that of climate change as a more recent issue as I feel as if it has not been as widely publicized until around my generation. I’m surprised that despite knowing of consequences that follow fossil fuel burning that no big changes took place. At the time of the energy crisis of the 1970’s, I feel like more progress was made because people were being directly affected by the energy crisis. People didn’t have access to gasoline and prices skyrocketed. Because this crisis directly affected their lives, people took an effort to turn to renewables. Jimmy Carter even installed solar panels on the White House. However, I feel as if we took steps back after we thought things were going ok. When our supply of gasoline was no longer in danger, people started to care less about our fossil fuel use. Ronald Reagan even took down the solar panels on the White House because he thought it sent the wrong message.
       <br><br>
This is all because people feel as if the climate crisis is not affecting them. In some ways, I do understand why they would feel that way. It is very hard to understand and empathize with the various crises across the world that are happening due to climate change if you are not there to experience them. However, we should be trying our best to make sure that no one around the world is suffering from the climate crisis, especially since we are such large contributors to it. Even if people don’t feel bad about the people who are suffering from the climate crisis, they should still try to take action. Climate change could easily take a toll on us here in California through various catastrophic weather events. If we don’t want that to happen, we need to make a change now. As Ken says, knowledge is power only when we take action upon it.

I have also always thought of the issues of climate change being a more recent issue. Your comment talks about people quickly, and frantically acting to change their lifestyles due to events such as the energy crisis in the 1970s. Consequently, as sad as it is to realize, I strongly believe that the American people will not change their lifestyles dramatically enough in order to avoid the consequences of carbon emissions unless something starts negatively impacting their lifestyles in an unavoidable way. For instance, gasoline is a prime example of an inelastic good that the American people were forced to create alternatives for or more closely manage their use of due to the skyrocket in price and loss of supply. In the case of the energy crisis, the people were educated and in return were taking steps to act towards a more sustainable and less fossil fuel dependent future. Although the world still contains quite large reserves of fossil fuels, it makes me wonder what will happen to the developed society once precious commodities such as oil are no longer available because so much of our society from transportation to manufacturing of goods relies on oil as an energy source. I also think that it's somewhat of a tragedy that Jimmy Carter, a president tried to lead by example by utilizing renewable energy just for Reagan to take them down because they send "the wrong message." If the wrong message is trying to diminish our reliance on non renewable, and carbon emitting energy sources then I am perfectly complacent being on the wrong side. Ultimately, I valued your point on people not being concerned with fossil fuel use when it isn't negatively affecting them directly. I feel as if this is just a part of human nature that I'm not quite sure how to address, because the reality of it is that fossil fuels are typically the most convenient and cheap options in the short term for most American people today.

Likewise, realizing that the discovery of climate change is nowhere near recent was surprising. To hear that it’s been decades upon decades since the first scientific findings of anthropogenic climate change makes me sympathize with the baby boomer generation and previous generations a little less. I also find it interesting how one of the first scientists to connect increased carbon dioxide levels and global temperature rise was a female. In the 1800s, it’s largely possible that her and her findings were put on the back burner, because of her circumstance of being a woman. Another fact that blew my mind to hear was the rise of vegetarianism in the 1970s as an act of climate change prevention, and not the hippie ethic lifestyle normally associated with it. The public knew that the meat industry was not sustainable but over time did they come to dismiss vegetarianism as just another aspect of the free spirit lifestyle? In response to the progress of sustainability in the 1970s, I completely agree that circumstance drove people and businesses alike to think greener. The middle eastern oil embargo was very revealing on how addicted the US is to fossil fuels. Yet as generations continued, sustainability efforts have not increased. A possibility of this inaction could be the bystander effect; people brush it aside assuming others are taking the necessary steps, and that they won’t be affected by the disasters of climate change because other people somewhere in the world are doing all the dirty work. And it’s true, there are people globally who dedicate their lives to saving our earth, but this is not enough. Worldwide, deliberate action is the only course we can take if we hope to continue our time on this planet.

We certainly can cut individual climate footprint; it’s a matter of whether we want or not. Voting and activism are the main ways to save our environment. In the video, there are five personal actions that we can do to avert the climate crisis. We can choose to walk, bike, and take public transportations rather than drive or own a carbon-based car. Instead of living in large suburban houses or mansions, we can switch into smaller and more efficient housing, such as co-housing and micro apartments. Moving to a city is another way to reduce carbon footprint because people tend to use public transportation rather than drive a car. More importantly, wasting food is a huge issue that we have to change our diet and choices; additionally, the high population also made the planet unsustainable since the resources are limited. I think we should at least take into some actions. If everyone participates a bit, the accumulated effects can have significant progress. 
       <br><br>


I agree that the older generations see the consuming lifestyle as a result of their hard work. They think that they should live, eat, and buy what they want. Accordingly, as the younger generation, we should convince older generations to make better choices. Besides, I’m surprised by how early the older generations knew about global warming. They did not act enough to reduce carbon emissions, which results in the situation we have today. To conclude, we should act upon our knowledge, which acts in response to what we know.

I agree with the second part of your comment in which older generations should really put some effort into the world issue and spend some time understand the importance of it. Although they might consider themselves no worth in taking actions, it's still significant to make them aware of what they contributed positively and negatively.

The average person knew about climate change back then as they do now, however now we are witnessing the consequences of it. It’s not shocking that the older generations want to hold on to what they have worked for  their entire lives. I mean could you imagine working your entire life for something and then someone comes along and tells you to leave it behind, yeah pretty brutal. But it's the reality that the older generations will have to get used to. They have acquired all of these things with hard work, yes, but also at the expense of the environment. Like Prof. Ken mentioned in the video, in the 1970’s, people were concerned with the use of fossil fuels, though not for environmental reasons, a transition from a fossil fuel economy to a renewable energy and sustainable economy should have been made. But the previous generation and those before them, were unwilling to remove themselves from such a profitable and cheap usage of fossil fuels… and now this generation and those that follow will suffer for it. I mean come on, even Jimmy Carter put solar panels on the White House . How could we have not made the transition, we’ve had plenty of time to make our wrongs right, yet we always go down the wrong path until it's too late. I agree with Lydon Johnson, we are in fact performing a “ vast geo-physical experiment” and damn those who suffer because of it. 
       <br><br>

I’ve heard “knowledge is power” quite a few times in my life, and never till this day, until your video did I realise that knowledge is just knowledge if not acted upon. I think many of us, at least in this class want to acquire as much knowledge about climate change as we can, yet how will we act upon this knowledge. How will we use what we’ve learned to do better than those before us. I think a lot of people have knowledge about the climate crisis, yet day after day, news after news, we see no action. I think maybe we see no action because there are forces conspiring against the truth. Climate denialism is at its core, a group of individuals who want to continue this fossil fuel addicted economy, and keep the public ignorant and complacent.

What I find so striking about these two videos is that, when viewed together, you get the sense that the boomers both knew about the climate crisis, felt its effects in the same vein that we do today (marginally, in the case of those living in my hometown of Chicago), and chose, very actively, to reject it. While I do, in some deep part of me, see that  that rejection was not a product of their own knowledge, but rather a a product of larger political forces being at play, I still do not hold full sympathy. With the knowledge of climate change all around them, whether they wanted to really face it or not, they chose not to act on it. You almost get the sense that climate change and the idea of "saving the environment" was a feminized pop-culture punchline when you watch old comedy movies and TV and see main characters looking down upon and joking with hippies and environmentalists who stage protests and refuse to eat meat. Looking at these old movies now and seeing this has forced me to realize just how long it has taken for society to warm up to these ideas (get it!), and that these ideas have only been taken seriously when climate change has actually started to take hold. 

       <br><br>

While I give the older generation just a sliver of my sympathy, I cant help but to also really think about how things might have been different if they had taken those crazy hippies seriously. If they had just stopped to think about the realities of what their lifestyles and overconsumption would do one day. How far, technologically speaking, we would have come had we focused our attention away from something like defense and more toward something like saving the world. But that was then, and now, we have to deal with the sad consequences of their inaction.

After watching this video, I had many questions regarding how much I can actually do to help the environment. I agree with what Ken said about how it is harder to change the older generations views of their lifestyle than it is to change our lifestyle, but how it is hard for our generation to change the way of life we were given at birth. It is crazy to me how long we have been expecting global temperatures to rise as a result of burning fossil fuels. If this has been common knowledge since the 1800’s, why have we not done more to stop it before it got this bad? At what point did this issue become a partisan issue? It blows my mind that huge companies have known about the harms of fossil fuels, but didn’t do anything about it. It makes me so angry that our country knew that these fossil fuels were going to lead to an insane catastrophe. If the first energy crisis was in the 1970’s, I don't understand how we havent done more to combat climate change in the past 50 years. Consequently, we are going to reap the effects of this poor choice to start combat climate change. When Ken talked about how knowledge being power, I agree that we have to act on the knowledge that we have to then exert power. We need to exert our power in order to do our part in helping save the planet.

I completely agree with this statement of yours, Carly. I personally believe that the lack of care to this situation given by past generations is actually not only because they weren't aware of the crisis at hand. It is obvious through the fact that it was known knowledge in the 1800s (that the global temperature was expected to rise due to fossil fuels) and the fact that there was an energy crisis at all that it was neglected knowledge, put on to a later date. I believe our issue stems back to the idea that people may not have seen it as an immediate issue in past generations because they had yet to experience serious consequences, and the information that has been around for over a century was swept under the rug for a future generation to deal with (which happens to be ours).  On a different note, I think that Ken's steps to helping out in this crisis are very doable and exciting to hear about. I feel as though many students happen to already do most of the suggestions such as using public transportation and living in apartments/shared living spaces, but it is good to also be prepared for the future and know the impact of having children, etc.

This week's lecture videos is probably one of my favorite lectures from Ken so far because it talks about exactly what we can do now to reduce our carbon footprint and how the climate crisis came to be. First, I want to point out a quote from this video because it really summarizes this entire fiasco about climate and what people can do. Ken says, "If acted on, knowledge is power. If not, knowledge is power squander." This is such a powerful quote to me and I agree with it wholeheartedly. If we know all these things we can do to stop climate change yet we don't actually pull through with it, it means nothing. It's the same saying as "All bark, no bite." or "All talk, no action." If we talk about the climate crisis and say we should do this and this yet no one wants to actually change their living habits, what's the point of talking about it still? I believe that people really should try and act on their words and just as Ken mentions, activism will get us far. 
       <br><br>


In the other lecture video, "Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?" I liked how Ken talked about 5 exact things we can do. I didn't know that so many daily things people do create such a big increase in terms of our carbon footprint. I also found myself doing some of the things Ken had already pointed out that I didn't even notice. The fact that UCSB has a place like Isla Vista is so comforting because we really are our own little city. The bus and bikes and by foot are the main modes of transportation, people resell their clothes all the time here, and people promote a very healthy eating style. People in Isla Vista see the effects of climate change first hand as well with the increased sea-level rise and increase erosions. Del Playa may not even be her in the next 20 years or so. I can see how some people may not be able to do all 5 possible solutions, but if every person on the planet did at least one or two out of the five, our carbon footprint would decrease massively. However, my only concern is that when will people start to take action though? When it's too late? I just hope everyone realizes that now is the time and there's no holding off on it.

Yes, yes, yes, and yes! Your comment hit every point that I was thinking while watching Ken’s videos. First off, these two lecture videos of the week were also my favorite so far, but especially this one. Ken ended off with such a powerful message that I know for a fact will stick by me for a very long time. When he mentions that knowledge is only power if acted upon, I had an epiphany; I was struck with realization in which I wasn't aware that I needed. I most definitely have knowledge on climate change and the consequences that come with it, I know of some actions we can take to slow the role of our crisis, I try to educate others that are unaware or oblivious to the crisis, but how much action have I myself taken to mitigate the problem? Not as much as I know I can, in this case, my knowledge is power squander as embarrassing it is to say. But now I am glad that I came to this realization and I am glad that I heard such a quote; that powerful quote made me reflect on my life choices and pushed me to consider what actions I am going to take now and in the future since I am aware of what actions I can taken give the five steps Ken mentioned. Those 5 simple solutions (I say simple because you don't need to break an arm to reduce our climate footprints as the older generation may believe) shouldn't be a burden, it should actually be a motivation for us because they would change our lives and future lives for the greater good. It is just a matter of whether or not one actually cares and chooses to participate.
<br><hr>
I also really liked this weeks lecture videos for the exact same reason. This is really the first time that Ken really lays out ways to reduce our carbon footprint, and I'm curious to hear what he has to say when he explores each of his proposed 5 ways in greater depth in the coming weeks. I really like how you connect his ideas to our current home here in Isla Vista. We really do experience these changes because we are a coastal community. I remember just the other week reading a news article about how a back deck off of house on Del Playa collapsed as erosion continues to wither our beautiful oceanside cliffs. One of the things that I really like about UCSB, as you mention, is the main methods of bike transport. I think that more places should promote bike transit with the expansion of bike paths. 

       <br><br>

The quote that you reference - "If acted on, knowledge is power. If not, knowledge is power squandered." is a statement that I very much agree with too. If you know something and don't act on it then what was the point of that knowledge in the first place. Say I know that my friend who is allergic to nuts is about to eat a coffee cake that has tree nuts in it and I don't say anything. That would be foolish of me and make me a bad friend. I'm glad that younger kids today are beginning to hold the older generation accountable for there role in the climate crisis today because, as Ken said in his 2nd lecture for the week, there was a general knowledge that if Americans did not change their habits we would be in for catastrophe. Squandered is really good word to categorize this waste of knowledge, because something could've been done - more like it should've been done. One thing I am concerned about is fossil fuel interests because they were well aware of what they were doing and the long-term consequences but yet they act and still act today which is immoral and wrong. When will we be able to hold them accountable?
<br><hr>

At first, when I hears his advice of moving to a big city to reduce your carbon footprint I was shocked. I always thought cities were worse for the environment with all the taxis, cars, people, and stores. But when I thought about it and listened to the reasoning, my opinion completely changed- cities like New York and basically the entire Bay Area have massive, easily accessible public transport that makes having a car essentially unnecessary. They have massive apartment buildings that house many, many more people per block than suburban housing does. People walk, take the train/subway/BART, scooter, or bike to where they need to go. As you mentioned, it's nice to see a lot of these steps already being implemented into IV and UCSB, but I also wonder when this way of living will be picked up in other communities. As we are living it, i note that it isn't a difficult way of living and wasn't a massive change from how I lived before college, but I wonder how people who grew up in different ways from my own will adapt (and if they will be willing to adapt) to these steps of living as well. As Ken said, most Americans are well aware to the damage they are doing to the world, but I wonder if they are willing to take that knowledge and apply it to their daily actions to negate that damage. I worry that even though many many people are taking the necessary steps, is it enough? and how can we get others to live in sustainable manners as well?

<br><hr>
I read your comment and I couldn’t agree with you more. I also particularly liked Ken’s amendment of the popular saying that ‘knowledge is power.’ I wholeheartedly agree that knowledge is only powerful when acted upon, and I liked his tie-in into the word activism. It is such a profound statement when he says that knowledge not acted upon is power that is squandered; it accurately describes the Boomer generation’s overall failure to address the issue of climate change despite many of them knowing about the potential consequences of extensive fossil fuel usage. 
       <br><br>

Just like you, this is one of my favorite lectures thus far from Ken. It’s not the first one in which he tells us what can be done to help combat the climate crisis, but the steps outlined in this video are clear easier to do on a personal level. In a previous video he stated that one of the most impactful things we can do is to take control of our countries: getting involved in politics and taking key government positions. I definitely think that is something that must be done, as time and time again the older generation has shown us that they are unwilling to make meaningful change even when they hold all the power needed to do so. Imagine a country where the government is filled with and run by bright, sharp-minded progressives such as AOC: I think that this is the type of leadership that the United States needs to start really taking an effective role in fighting the climate crisis. But of course, that’s almost akin to a political revolution and not everyone is suited to politics and leadership. So the simple lifestyle changes that Ken recommends in this video are far more appealing to a wider audience of people, while still being able to produce a noticeable, collective effect.

<br><hr>
Like the rest of the people who commented on this comment, I also completely agree with you and think that you've hit every major point that was relevant to these videos. Knowledge is power and we have the power to reform and change the direction that our earth is going towards. As human beings, we are selfish and all 5 solutions that Ken presented may not be in the cards for everyone, however, we can all take part in at least one or two. Anyone is able to become vegetarian, regardless of your job, where you live, etc. When talking to my parents about this issue, they both agreed that the biggest issue we are having is population. While they had four kids themselves they, of course, do not regret, but they agree that if people were to have better sex education and birth control that a population problem would become less of an issue in this respect. I would like to point out that if someone longs to have a larger family that there are many many kids in need of homes through foster care and adoption services as opposed to having more than two kids yourself. 
       <br><br>

There's no easy solution for this. People will have to make the change and want to do better for the planet. Our generation will be the one who is feeling the repercussions of the climate change so naturally, we care the most and our generation will be the ones who make the change.

<br><hr>

Ken’s statement on knowledge being power completely resonated with me. There are many people who do not know what to personally do to help mitigate the effects of climate change and there are many who do know about the issue yet do not implement their own knowledge to help others understand. Although there is more activism in today’s world, I have also noticed many belittling each other when one is misinformed or uninformed about certain issues. It only creates this gap between people where ignorance develops on both sides leading to awareness being deterred. 
       <br><br>
 His video on things that could be done to help mitigate the effects of climate change had been introduced to me in my environmental class in high school. At the moment I learned about it I changed my way of living even if they were small changes. Switching from beef to chicken. Car pooling was easy because I don’t know how to drive. Just by making a few changes completely lowered my carbon footprint by a lot. Moving to Isla Vista definitely lowered my footprint more as we transport mainly through bicycles or bus transportation. I appreciate Isla Vista in this way so much because we are mostly all practicing to lower our carbon footprint even in the smallest ways. I made these small changes in high school and it had improved my footprint that now I look for more ways to reduce it more. If the lifestyle in Isla Vista makes these same changes to others living in it, and as more people are environmentally aware, it gives me hope that soon more and more people will also begin to decrease their carbon footprint as well.

I don't really blame people for not acting even though they knew something bad could happen through their reliance on fossil fuels. It was hard to pin point the main sources, but a big problem that contributes to climate change that we are aware of now is the meat industry. I have never seen "Cowspiracy" but I have watched a youtube video called "The Meatrix". Ken, I recommend playing this video because its based on "The Matrix" and Neo is pig on a farm and Morpheus is a cow that shows him how bad the meat industry is. After watching this video last quarter I decided to go vegetarian. I don't usually feel judged by my family, but being home for winter break and telling family members I was vegetarian was one of the few times I got rude comments back. One of my uncles said 'that's so LA of you". I think saying something like this undermines the whole movement of plant-based diets. There is valid environmental and moral reasoning behind people not eating meat and his comment just shows how some people have created a stigma around vegans/vegetarians. I think overall it was just a very ignorant comment and most people make comments like this because they themselves are unaware of the problems of the meat industry. Many Americans just have little to no knowledge on climate change and thus the lack of action by the U.S. as a whole.

<p>
Knowledge is power only when acted on. No matter how much I try to promote climate activism to those around me, I feel as if it does not go through to most people. For example, with credibly cited material, I have explained to my relatives the benefits of a plant based diet and how the meat and dairy industry makes devastating impacts to our environment. Although, I do mention the sources of my given information, and explain the topic in depth, they largely do not believe what I am saying is true. Many people give little thought about how their actions are destructive to the Earth despite climate change discourse. Furthermore, it seems as if they do not accept this information as it seems burdensome for them to tweak their daily habits. I believe they would rather turn a blind eye and accept ignorance rather than allow themselves to believe the facts to be entirely true. For instance, recently my friends asked me to go shopping at Forever 21, a chain clothing department, notorious for fast fashion. In result, I told them I gave up my old tendencies to shop at major retail stores like this because of its negative impacts on the planet. As I rejected their offer, they responded with laughter, inferring that I was being foolish and extreme, maybe because I had offended them somehow.

I have found that the same thing has happened with my circle of people. I have been on my own environmentally friendly journey since high school and I did it all alone. I wouldn’t throw my veganism in their face but would always offer for people to try my food. I would politely answer any questions regarding veganism and how to transition. It has taken four years of sharing articles and videos with my family members via email and social media for them to finally start making changes.. But hey, at least it’s happening. When it comes to shopping for clothes I encourage my friends to visit thrift stores and not retail stores, and if they have the money to buy locally. In my household, I suggested the idea of planning out meals for the week to reduce food waste. So, while it may be a fact that 25% of greenhouse gas emissions were produced by the US and people have known about the damage being done since the 70s, it doesn’t mean I am going to give up my lifestyle and it doesn’t mean it is too late to start transitioning to a more eco friendly lifestyle. As you and Ken mentioned. Knowledge is power only when acted on.

<p>
I was shocked by the solutions that Ken has provided for us. It’s surprisingly easy. Getting all these five things done can cut half carbon footprints for each one of us. Using more public transportation, getting into apartments/co-housing, getting no more than two kids, stop the waste of food, and reducing overconsumption, all these five things can not only reduce carbon dioxide emission but also encourage all of us to have more healthy living habits. Yet, knowing all these theories is not enough. Knowledge is power only if we act upon it. As we see in the lecture, the boomer generation has all realized what’s happening around them; they all have the knowledge that they need to quickly change something, for example, to find new renewable energy in response to the energy crisis in the 1970s, but they did nothing for it. So the responsibility, or the burden, moves to my generation again. I was also wondering why people still didn’t act in response to the climate crisis. It’s an urgent thing that all of us need to pay close attention to. Actually, if each one of us willing to make a little change in our life, things could become better dramatically. Following the simple steps Ken provided, we could make the future better collectively. 
        <br><br>
The videos are really impactful, since Ken continues to emphasize how emergent it is to save our planet, and I firmly believe it is what we all need to do now. Even though the cause of the current climate crisis still remains debatable, we could take our actions no matter what.

I was really surprised by the fact that people were already aware of the effects of greenhouse gases and human impact on the environment in the 70s. It's confusing to me that nothing was really done to solve it, and the problem was only made much worse. If society acted as soon as they found out it was an issue, we probably could have solved it by now. All of the suggestions Ken made to reduce one’s carbon footprint didn’t seem that difficult to me. The issue is that America is a very consumerist country and it would be really hard to convince everyone to give up their wasteful and extravagant lifestyles, as they believe they worked hard for it so they deserve it. Every time I make comments to my friends about things like not using plastic water bottles or not wasting so much food, they always argue that it's their right to live the lifestyle they want. Its really hard to convince people to change their lifestyle for something greater than themselves, where they won’t directly see their impact. In my sophomore year of high school, I had an assignment where I had to figure out my carbon footprint, and I was honestly astonished by how large it was. I always considered myself a very environmentally conscious person, and I had no idea that I was not doing much better than the average person. I think out of all the suggestions Ken made, the biggest impact humans can make is the number of children they have. I understand that its everybody's right to choose how many children they have, but I just think its kind of selfish to have more than two kids per couple. We physically cannot support more people on Earth, as we don’t have the resources. I think the best way to start would be to educate more about birth control and try to prevent unplanned pregnancies as much as possible.

I feel so sad when I know we had a chance to prevent climate change from happening, but we didn’t take it. However, it is relatively easy for me understand them since their generation had been tough period, and everything they have now is gained by effort. I’m not saying everything is right about their lifestyle. Instead, consumerism is not necessarily related to developed society, and living a sustainable life doesn’t mean to lose freedom. I also did a carbon footprint test last year, and the result shocked me. Based on my old lifestyle, it needs 2.5 earth to support world population if everyone else live a same life as mine. According to the result, my carbon emission primarily comes from international flight and beef consumption. Knowing how my lifestyle is bad to the earth, I began to eat less meat and shift my diet to chicken. And I insist to take public transportation or bike. I know these are tiny change but if everyone on this earth do the same thing, the consequence would be astonishing.

Action is power. Ken repeatedly tells us that the boomer generation knew about climate change. So what? What can we do with this information? We know that since the 1970s people knew that society needed to wean off of the use of fossil fuel. We know that people in Ken’s generation knew the problem and denied the problem. We know that Lyndon Johnson reported on climate change stating that the CO2 levels would slowly rise and increase the average temperature. With this information about the boomer generation, we know that we can do better. People have been educated on this topic since the 1970s and still haven’t made a drastic change. The 21st-century average person has heard of climate change. They might not know all the details and the actual detrimental effects; however, people know it exists. Yet, we are still not making drastic changes. We are not weaning off fossil fuel use and we haven’t created a societal day of meatless Mondays. We are becoming educated and we are still not taking action. “Knowledge is power,” is it? We have all the facts that we need and we still feed into learning more and not taking collective action. At this rate, our society is doomed, we need to take action, how much more information do we need to finally change?




</p><hr>

<p>

Knew about it, but didn’t act on, that just shows the lack of responsibility the boomer generation had for our futures. It hurts to know that the tools and problem was laid out before older generations, yet nothing happened. Don’t get me wrong, I love our American lifestyle, but if change is what we need to survive, changes must then be made. Even Ken gave us five simple things that all of us can do to help our planet, but again, older people refuse to act. Habit is the only excuse for the older generation to keep their ways and continue a planet that won’t fully feel the effects until after they are gone. I believe that we as the next generation have to be as vocal as possible now. If we continue to wait till we are given power, we may have not acted swiftly enough, and our planet would already be doomed. 

        <br><br>

I can’t help but think how our lives and worries would differ now if the older generation would have acted. We would not have to worry about the impending climate crisis and we would already be trained in a lifestyle that would conserve our resources. I know that it is not helpful to anyone to dwell in the past but I am just angered that we were put in this position. You would think the science would convince all generations of the trouble we are in and make them want to make up for the figurative hole they have put us in, but they continue to say that climate change is not an issue. Honestly it is getting to the point where they shouldn’t have a say, we are the ones who have to deal with climate change so why should they decided our future on the issue? It makes no sense. I hope next week we learn about more possible solutions because it is looking like we are the only generation that cares about our planet's future.

In the first lecture, Ken introduced 5 ways people can take in their daily lives to mitigate climate crisis. However, after considering each of them carefully, I found that some of them are not as simple as they seem to be. I need to mention that I am not saying these ways terrible or unachievable. My point is that people have to change their value, which is the difficult part, to achieve these goals. Taking housing for an example, in most cases, the bigger the house is, the more successful a person seems to be. More than half of the students indeed agree with what Ken mentioned and have the confidence to realize them. However, here is a scenario which I am worried about: when I have my own family after graduating from school, will my mind, my value, get changed? In other words, can I keep being a kind of minimalism while promising my family a happy life in the meantime? The answer is not settled yet. However, there is still something we can easily do. For example, we should choose to take public transportation if we do not have any special reasons. In Santa Barbara, it is free and convenient for us to take buses around here. 
        <br><br>

In the second lecture, it becomes clear that people had already known about the negative impacts of the overuse of oil and the importance of a plant-based diet as early as the 1950s. Sadly, people at that time did not take immediate action as early as possible. Just as Ken mentioned in the video, “If acted on, knowledge is power. If not, knowledge is power squander.” As students, we are now attending lectures to obtain knowledge, but it is far from enough. We need to, and we have to apply this knowledge into our life.



</p><hr>

<p>

After watching video #4 in the series, I felt like the solutions were pretty reasonable. There's definitely ways to adapt the current solutions Ken proposes to fit one's current lifestyle. For instance, if people are unable or unwilling to completely switch to a plant based diet, they can greatly limit their consumption of beef and instead switch to proteins like chicken, which are relatively not as bad for carbon emissions. 

        <br><br>

The video got me thinking "why does the older generation not see it as I do?". Specifically, I thought about environmental issues from my parent's perspective. My parents immigrated from India in the early 1990's. They did not come from absolute poverty, but definitely did not come from wealth either. My dad dropped everything to get a job working in the Bay Area, and my mom left her government teaching position to raise a family in america. As I was growing up here and was faced with "first world problems" like having too much homework or not getting a food I liked for dinner, my mom would always tell me stories that ended in the sentiment, count your blessings. And she was right. My mom grew up with studying for exams by candlelight when her house lost power during finals week for college, and my dad had similar struggles of growing up as well. My parents came from having the bare necessities to having luxuries with their hard earned money after moving to America. This shared immigrant experience of having the ability to have a lot more than before is something that may contribute to the generational view that "I should be able to buy, consume, and live wherever I want, because I earned it. While I do not know if my parents believe this sentiment completely, the first video contrasting the two responses from the generations may contribute largely to the immigration experience. I think someone my age who has recently moved to America from a region of poverty may align more with the older generation's sentiment. Of course, I cannot say for certain, but I think understanding this issue from an immigration standpoint is an interesting thing to look at. 

        <br><br>

I also thought the history of when Americans began to know about climate change's effects was interesting. Im a little skeptical as to whether the average American did really know Climate change in of itself was a big deal, because I don't think a lot of people think twice about rising gas prices, other than the fact that they are rising. I'd be curious to delve deeper into this issue, and I hope it's discussed in lecture.

Your comment absolutely resonated with me. Consumer culture is something that is sought after where people don’t have it. We’re so used to seeing big spending in the media, off the top of my head, Ariana Grande’s “Seven Rings” is literally about buying a ton of stuff that us peasants cannot afford. If the media could express that success, even monetary success, looks different than fancy cars and ridiculous price tags, this would hugely affect the state of our climate. 
        <br><br>

Switching to a less meat heavy, more environmentally friendly diet is not a “new” concept, I found it interesting that its roots were that far back in the 20th century, and its saddening to know that people’s moral laziness has been around all this time.
        <br><br>

I also agree strongly with your sentiment of doubt towards whether “the average person” knew that greenhouse gases were leading to significant earth heating and other drastic consequences. Yes, president LBJ addressed in a speech to Congress, yes Carter put up some solar panels, yes some prominent scientists made predictions, but none of this is everyday people stuff. My dad is of Ken’s generation, and he claims to have learned about climate change in the 90s. When Ken makes blanket statements about “when the boomer generation knew,” it leaves room for no nuance, when in reality, a lot of the claims used as evidence seem oddly specific and esoteric.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with this statement, the solutions in video 4 seemed reasonable and doable to me. I would not mind apartment living, taking public transport, and living a more minimalistic lifestyle. However, when I take on the solutions from the viewpoints of my parents, I understand that this life is something they are not willing to give up. They have immigrated to the US from Burma with very little money and worked all types of jobs to support themselves. They did this so I and my sister could live better lives than they did, and so we could get a better education and more opportunities. It took them years to become stable financially here and they're still struggling but now living comfortably. As a child, I saw them working day and night shifts and immediately falling asleep on the couch the moment they got home. I would occasionally go with them to the night shifts because they didn't want to leave me home alone. I saw them struggle and now they're stable enough to send me to ucsb and get the education they immigrated here for. I know that child to parent learning is the most effective and I do tell them to recycle and be environmentally aware. But it would break my heart to tell them to sell this house and move or to use public transport and sell the car they can finally afford. I can not see them giving up all these expensive belongings, and I understand because I witnessed them working so hard for it. 
        <br><br>
Another issue is that my mother works at a gas station, which influences the climate directly with the CO2 emissions. But it is owned by a family friend and one of the only places to hire her, as she does not speak much English, does not have the highest education, and is not very good with technology. This is not something I can change or tell them to stop doing because it's one of the only jobs she was able to get. From an immigrant standpoint, I fully understand not being able to make the lifestyle change.
<br><hr>
I feel that being a first gen puts us in a weird position. We want to see our parents live out their dreams, but at the same time want to be able to strike a balance. I definitely want to have a conversation with my parents about this and see whether they get it. I wonder, does coming from a less developed part of the world and being raised with less privilege maybe make them more grateful and willing to save the environment, since they've seen it at its worst when they were growing up in less/close to poverty? Do you maybe have the same suspicion?
<br><hr>
Before watching this video, I assumed that the reason we have not been able to do much against climate change was because we did not know about this.  This video changed that belief as it was stated that the previous generation knew that the carbon emissions we have been releasing into the planet were damaging the planet, yet we did not do much about it.  I had believed that we did not need to place much blame on previous generations because they did not know nor did they want to know what their fossil fuel usage has done to the planet.  But now I see that it was not that they did not know, it was that they chose not to do anything about what they knew.  
        <br><br>
This surprised me because it does not take much to reduce your carbon footprint.  It may be because I am from the younger generation, but the lifestyle changes suggested in the other lecture video really did not seem very drastic.  The fact that many older people do not want to make slight changes to their lifestyle in order to help make a world that future generations can live in is disappointing because I am part of the group that will live through the consequences of their actions.
        <br><br>
Furthermore, I now also realize the impact that politics has had on our feelings on climate change.  I believed it was being unaware of the effects of climate change that prevented America from taking action against it.  But, in actuality, we did have knowledge on what our actions have been doing to the planet.
<br><hr>

Your comment intrigued me so much that I have to respond. In the prior video, I contrasted how I see the difference between generations that Ken was talking about. My generation, our generation, is much more open to adapting and changing our lifestyles to save our earth whereas previous generations, like Ken’s, are more hesitant. For the latter, they believe they worked so hard that they should not sacrifice it for the sake of possibly helping the environment. It doesn’t help that some believe the climate crisis is just a hoax. One of the topics I discussed was the idea of using used clothes. I think thrift shopping is great and it became even more popular on Twitter, seeing the wonderful yet cheap discoveries that could be made. But when I brought up thrifting to my mother, she was not happy from it and protested I could get cheap clothes from Ross or Marshalls that weren’t used by strangers.
        <br><br>

I do believe in this contrast of the immigrant experience because my mom grew up poor. She doesn’t want her daughter to wear old, used clothes because she wants to make my upbringing better than hers. She was raised in the Philippines and immigrated here at age 18. She worked for us to be where we are today; we can afford to eat out and buy new clothes occasionally. She wouldn’t get nor like how a woman who has hustled for her parents, for her kids, and for herself would need to make changes over those in power and are wealthy by inheritance or even just in general. I get how their viewpoint can correspond with the older generation’s sentiment, as you said. In regards to the history of how Americans knew there would be consequences as a result of these fossil fuel companies yet continued with their action AND continued to let decades of warnings pass by is a completely different story. I still have so many questions about that. Just why? Imagine living from the beginning of this until now and still being ignorant. Imagine experiencing the effects and negative impact and still refusing to change or to advocate for change. Horrible.
<br><hr>

I agree with you. Professor Hiltner provided us with 5 realistic solutions we can all implement in our lives to help reduce our carbon footprint. The generational responses are extremely intriguing to look into as older generations see these solutions as taking away their freedom and what they worked for, but for us, freedom is being able to coexist with the planet, not destroy it. It was also super interesting to hear about your upbringing and the differences your parents and you faced growing up! I think that is an important facet of a lot of people’s lives; as in today’s world with social media and technology, we grew up in a society based around consumerism. This is all we have known so for some people it’s hard to wrap your mind around living any other way. I think Professor Hiltner’s interpretation of knowledge is also important to keep in mind because we are the future and if we don’t act on the knowledge we have from this class, or films we watch, or books we read, then how can we expect anyone else to act?
<br><hr>
I agree that culture plays a huge role in generational understanding of the climate crisis. In a similar manner, my parents also immigrated here at a young age to escape the Vietnam War and when people immigrate here, they are faced with a new world with new worries. Similarly, my mom had to work 60+ hour weeks to support my family, learn a completely new language, and learn how to navigate this American society and culture. Protecting the environment was probably the least of her priorities and honestly I don’t blame her. It wasn’t out of ignorance in these cases, but it was the case that unfortunately besieges many people. When people drown in work and life, they don’t take the time to educate themselves and take the individual actions necessary to combat the climate crisis.
        <br><br>

But for those in the baby boomer generation and before who were born and raised in America, they had it much easier than our immigrant parents. They were here in America and actually had the ability to change the course of this climate crisis and chose not to.

<p>

The first lecture gives a glimpse of five personal actions we can take to mitigate climate crisis in which is reasonable and achievable. Taking myself as an example, I rode my bike to school everyday when I was in high school and it’s merely a small step towards an environmentally-friendly way of living. Regarding housing issues, I think it’s closely related to the population to area ratio of one country. Americans tend to live in houses rather than flat apartments since they have a quite low density of population in majority areas. Oppositely in China, apartment and co-housing is a prevailing choice. Personally speaking, changing in diet is quite difficult and requires courage, but I’ll try to consume less meat as I once did before. I was astonished by the amount of greenhouse gases produced by beef production. As suggested by Ken, acted upon knowledge is power, it’s crucial for us to employ these tactics in daily life.
        <br><br>


In the second lecture, Ken presents the history of greenhouse production and lists several celebrities. Even though people debate on the level of human intervention in accelerating global warming, there is no denying that increasing emissions of green house gases leads to warmer weathering conditions. Adopting renewable energy is our goal at present and our progress towards avoiding power squander.



</p><hr>

<p>

“If acted on, knowledge is power. If not, knowledge is power squander.” This is a sentence personally resonates for me in the lecture. Fifty years ago, almost all of the Americans knew that it would be extremely harmful to the environment if people keep relying on using fossil fuel as well as consuming a great amount of meat. Also, there were plenty of scientists at that time who published their works to warn people about global warming. With all this knowledge, people at that time knew that if they continuing their damaging actions, the climate would be changed and all the species would be threatened. However, due to the strange delay of the consequences of the climate crisis and some of the other factors as well, people who lived during the 1970s almost ignored this issue, thus lost a perfect chance to save the planet.
        <br><br>
We should not make the same mistake as the old generation, which knowing the climate crisis but without effective actions. As for the young generation, we must act right now, and we should protect the environment in our daily life as the professor mentioned in “Can one generation do what previous generation failed to do.” By changing our lifestyle such as transportation, housing and so on, we can significantly reduce our damage to the climate. There is no time to waste for dealing with the climate crisis, we the young generation should not let our “knowledge become power squander.”

This closing really struck me as well. To think that so many people knew of these problems long ago and still chose not to act is very disheartening. I agree with Ken’s statement about action. Having knowledge of the problems occurring and even knowledge of how to fix them is not enough, it is nothing unless you do something with it. Years ago people did nothing with it and look where we are now. It scares me, though, to think that people act the same way now. If you asked someone on the street if they know what climate change is and what the causes are they would probably be able to give you at least a brief answer, but if you asked the same person how they are using that knowledge to actively change their habits to stop climate change they probably wouldn’t have an answer. In the other lecture from this week, Ken gives five ways to reduce your carbon footprint: reduce driving cars, waste less food and eat more plant-based meals, downsize housing, have less children, and rethink when buying new things. These are things that anyone can do and it is now up to our generation to actually do it. If we choose not to make these actions then our power will be just as squandered as previous generations.


<br><hr>

The quote, “If not acted upon knowledge is power, squandered” also resonated with me because I never looked at the opposing side of that argument before. It’s true that more knowledge will lead to more power, but, also, it is very possible that a person with a lot of knowledge can limit their power by not utilizing what they know. Implementing knowledge into action is a crucial aspect of power and that’s exactly what the boomer generation didn’t do. Their stagnant nature with the knowledge they possessed on the climate crisis, lead to the consequences we are facing today. I hope our generation doesnt follow in the footsteps of the older generations and practices a more sustainable lifestyle in order to save our climate. Because compared to the older generations, I feel as though we have even more knowledge on the topic and have experienced many of its consequences, so ignoring these signs would be true ignorance. I think it is important that we elect officials that take extreme importance to the issue and if we don’t, as individuals, we need to be the change in order to make a difference. We need to make our knowledge power.

<br><hr>
The argument, “if not ted upon, knowledge is power squandered”, is really striking in the way that it points out exactly the reason why previous generations failed to stop the climate change with only a few words. Indeed, action is, in some sense, more important than the pale knowledge itself. It warns our younger generation that we can no longer ignore the consequences of consuming fossil fuels and related stuff. Back then, they had plenty of time to waste and not act at all; But now we are running out of time. We have to resist the temptation of fossil fuels in order to survive. We know so much about how to reduce our carbon footprint like replacing cars by bikes or by foot, but only with actions can such methods really work out. Only thinking about these in our heads won’t do any favor under such an urgent circumstance. We have to act! We can choose to become a vegetarian right now; we can reduce our food wastes right now; we can stop buying stuff that we don’t really need right now; we can do all of these just from this very point! How long are we going to waste in waiting? We cannot afford to wait and sit there doing nothing any longer.

Before watching this video I was aware that Ken's generation was aware of their actions and the devastating consequences they would have, but I was unaware that most Americans also knew that what they were doing would eventually negatively effect the earth. After watching this video I was shocked to hear that most people knew about the potential consequences but they only feared it and made no effort to stop it. Hearing how it is more common now to buy a larger home in America and how children now want more and bigger and better than their parents and doing that will only negatively affect the earth. I agree that our generation needs to learn from this cautionary tale and take into consideration Ken's other lecture and do our best to reduce our own carbon footprint, even if it is only by a little. As Americans we need to cut down on food waste because hearing that a little over 1/3rd of our food is wasted and that number is sickening to me. There are countries where there is a constant lack of food but America has such an abundance that wasting 1/3rd of the amount is the norm. I also believe that cutting down on transportation would significantly reduce CO2 emissions and would dramatically lower ones carbon footprint as gas emits a lot of CO2 over time. 
        <br><br>

After watching this video I realized that the older generation truly knew what they were doing, especially the fossil fuel companies who to this day are still corrupt. Climate change has been a fear and a concern for decades and it gained more awareness in the 1970s but even then no-one made an effort to delay their productivity and continued to do all the things they knew would potentially be catastrophic to the earth. It hurts me to think that this generation knew that they were going to mess up the future environment for their offspring and they did not care as they did nothing to prevent what will occur in years to come. Ken was right about his generation, if they would have taken action in the 1970s and assisted in preventing climate change his generation could have been an example to the generations to come that if you make lifestyle changes you could significantly decrease the carbon footprint and the negative effects on the earth. Watching this video only furthered my understanding that the earth is already going through this delayed climate change and if myself and my generation do not do anything about it then the earth will end in catastrophe even sooner than expected.

It’s such an interesting hypothetical to consider how different our circumstances would be if action was taken in the 1970s. Once the U.S. hit peak oil, what if we started leaning towards solar energy rather than relying on foreign countries to ship us more oil for use? I probably wouldn’t be taking this class, that’s for sure. It bothers me so much that people were very aware of what they were doing, but couldn’t be bothered enough to take action to change. People were so invested in their own interests, and they couldn’t be bothered to consider the consequences that would be faced by future generations.
        <br><br>
 I also definitely think that we need to do our best to cut down on our carbon footprint. The five lifestyle changes that Ken mentioned all seem very reasonable, though the reactions to the suggestions by the older generations are definitely reactions I’ve heard before. They are selfish reactions. So many older people continue to buy large houses, buy cars, and have large families because they feel they have earned it, which they have. But when they do this, they disregard the lives of future generations, choosing their own present happiness over the livelihood of a future human. This is clearly a selfish decision. As the generation with the chance to curb emissions, we have to make unselfish decisions and change our lifestyles to help our Earth. We are as aware of global warming as the generations before us, if not more aware. It is our responsibility to lead the way in living lifestyles that are beneficial for our planet, and acting on our knowledge to use it as power, rather than squandering it.

After watching the two videos, I realized that there had been various actions for the environment long ago, but now we have all kinds of discussions on the authenticity of climate change. At that time, people knew that over-dependence on fuel and meat would have a bad impact on the environment. Over the years, we still haven't taken any measures to protect the environment, and because of the interests, we have greatly increased the exploitation of fossil fuels, and the demand for meat is also increasing. Five suggestions for me, although I can't become a vegetarian completely, at present I live in an apartment with two other people, and I seldom drive in my daily life unless I go far. Although I can't live a completely low-carbon life, I can only change some habits without affecting my normal life.

I realized that this is so true. It is so sad that we as Americans have known for so long that this was a pressing issue yet we made no change. Since 1970's, people fear CO2 and they knew fossil were connected to meat. I think it is interesting that people like Eunice Foote and ideas like the theory of peak oil showed that there were scientific facts being discovered yet influential people like Jimmy Carter only put up solar panels on the white house for support. 

        <br><br>

I think it is very scary to think that one day we may be out of oil and fossil fuels. I worry for America and I hope the best for the generation after me. I hope that maybe the rising price in oil will cause people to stop using oil and help make a change. I also think it is crazy that people like President Trump are still against climate change and I hope that we can change those viewpoints with scientific facts and through informing others.

Throughout the past two weeks of learning about the dangers and daunting reality of climate change, I was incredibly interested to learn how I could make a difference. This week’s lecture videos were both insightful and thought-provoking as it taught me how to reduce my carbon footprint and the importance of using the knowledge that I gain from this class and converting it into action. I found that living on campus I am already doing most of the suggestions from Ken’s video “Can one generation do what the previous generation failed to do?” I do not have a car and get around by walking or skateboarding so I am no longer contributing to carbon emissions with transportation. I used to live in the suburbs but now I am living in a dorm where I share all the utilities with other people. At the dining commons, I grab what I can eat and always clean my plate. In my opinion, the most interesting point in the video was the different views between different generations. The younger generation, like me, view these five points as unchallenging and somewhat desirable. I definitely agree with that mindset because as I listened to Ken introduce each of the steps to reduce my carbon footprint, I found myself thinking that these “solutions” were very do-able. At the same time, I can understand why the older generation would be against addressing climate change because of their comfortable state and their history. They worked hard to get where they are which is their justification to enjoy the rest of their lives. I feel like that kind of thinking is both ignorant and selfish. The younger generation should not have to deal with the consequences of an older generations actions, especially when the older generation is still alive and capable of contributing to the results of their actions.
         <br><br>

 The second lecture video addresses whether or not the boomer generation knew about the climate crisis and when they knew about it. I was not particularly surprised when I learned that people in the 1970s knew about the climate crisis but simply did not act upon it. Most people agreed that the United States had to steer away from fossil fuels and consuming meat because it was clear that there would be consequences. However, even with this knowledge, the Americans did not act. This gets me worried because who is to say that history will not repeat itself? It is convenient to be idle and enjoy life for what it is in the present. It is easy to brush off the existence of climate change, even if one learns about every aspect of it if the climate crisis isn’t directly affecting an individual. Those who are being affected right now are incapable of making any big changes to climate change because they have been devastated by its effects. My biggest worry is that people will not act fast enough and hold onto this knowledge just like how the older generation held onto the knowledge of the climate crisis.

I agree, after a few weeks of learning about how human action and inaction have caused the increasing rate of the climate crisis, I was ready to learn about how we can make a change. Throughout the first lecture video, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” I too found myself realizing that by living on campus, I am already implementing some of Ken’s five suggestions into my daily life. I am lucky to already be in a position in which I walk or bike to class, eat are largely plant based diet, and live with two other roommates. Although I can understand the perspective of the older generations, I think that even the smallest changes in lifestyle can make a change. For example, I helped convince my friends to take part in “Meatless Monday” because even if we eliminate meat for one day of the week, an impact can be made. If lots of people decided to change their lifestyles, even in the slightest way, a difference could be made in the consumption patterns and demand of goods such as meat.
         <br><br>
Regarding the second video, I was surprised to learn that since the 1970s, average Americans were aware of the negative impacts that their lifestyles were having on the planet. I was unaware that as early as 1854, scientists knew that rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere would raise the global temperatures and that by 1965, the President’s Science Advisory Committee predicted that by the year 2000, increases in levels of CO2 would be close to 25%, which could in turn create a large and destructive effect. If the boomer generation knew about the severity of climate change and that they should act immediately, then why didn’t they? This concerns me because what if this younger generation, who will face the consequences of the climate crisis decide to ignore the problem and remain inactive? We need to apply the knowledge that we have, not just acknowledge the facts. 
         <br><br>
This reminds me of a “tragedy of the commons” situation in which many people derive benefits from a subtractable resource that is threatened by their aggregate use. The earth is the subtractable resource that is threatened by our “bigger is better” mindset, and if we do not make an effort to change our habits and supersized mindsets, we will deplete the Earth of all the resources that keep us alive. Philosopher Immanuel Kant would suggest that regardless of what others do, every person should reduce his or her usage of the commons to the level that all could adopt without depleting it. We should follow this idea before it is too late.

<p>
After watching this and the previous video, I gathered two main ideas. The first is that the transition between living a life with a heavy carbon footprint and one that is significantly smaller comes down to 5 simple lifestyle changes. For me, personally, these five changes don't seem that difficult. I am already vegetarian and use walking and the public bus as my modes of transportation. Additionally, I only go clothes shopping when I absolutely need something. In regards to the other two points, I don't own my own home and do not have any children at this point in my life. While I am just one person, it seems that these subtle changes are quite reasonable to ask of the American population. While there are certain groups that may not have the means to create these changes due to living in remote areas or affordability, there are still large groups that can easily adjust. 
         <br><br>

The second idea that became quite clear is that there was plenty of knowledge about environmental problems as early as the 1950s. There was significant documentation about excessive oil usage and the benefits of a plant based diet. While these issues were not brought up in direct connection to climate change, they were still seen as problems that negatively effected the earth in some way. I am not sure if this makes me feel better about my parents' generation or worse. Yes, they were aware of these issues, but at the same time, they made no significant changes to American industries or lifestyles. Activists, at the time, were seen as hippies and did not garner a mainstream following. 
         <br><br>

The fact that climate change issues have been apparent for generations and that the way to slow or halt the damage is so simple, should motivate Americans to make the change. But, it hasn't and that's why the issue is so urgent now.

I agree that these five changes are very small asks of the American people.  Unfortunately, I feel if we pose it as environmental changes, less people are apt to adapt.  On the other hand, if we point out that these changes are largely cheaper than their counterparts, the public is more likely to take them on.  This goes back to our week one assignments, specifically talks of the carbon tax.  If we make gasoline and meat more expensive, people will generally gravitate to other options.  
         <br><br>

I feel that even though the public knew the effects of their actions, they were not faced with the consequences of their actions everyday.  This goes back to the tobacco analogy, people were less likely to buy those products when the health warning is put onto them.  Even my meat-eater friends have said that if there was a similar environmental warning on a package of beef, they would choose something else.  When faced with the repercussions, people will adapt.  I feel this is why environmental activism has become so prevalent today, we are finally seeing the effects of previous decisions.

All I can say is how sad.  For DECADES, people knew changes had to be made and if they were not made then disaster would shortly follow.  People knew that what they were doing was harmful and would later culminate to cause global catastrophe.  At the time, these were just simple changes that people could make to prevent catastrophe, yet they didn’t.  They did not act upon their knowledge, squandering their power.  In the 1950s, much research and information came out about the impact of human action on the environment.  Through this people became educated and knew about what they were doing and what effects would result in the future.  In the 1970s, all average Americans knew that we must wean ourselves off of fossil fuels and meat.  Yet here we are, 50 years later, and what has changed?  NOTHING.  Humans are continuing their destructive path, only increasing the impact through rising rates of fossil fuel extraction and usage and meat consumption.  Well, to be honest, I’d be lying by saying nothing has changed because our reality is that the global environment has changed, and definitely not for the better.  It continues to downward spiral as humans continue to destroy it.  Each year, the rates of consumption increases and with our fossil fuel reliant society, there seems to be no end in sight, despite the possibility of mass use of renewable energy sources in the future.  And what are those who knew about the impending global catastrophe from the 1950s-1970s doing?  Many of them nothing, just denying that the way of life that they passed onto future generations is harmful to the world.  But now, it is time to take the knowledge that they failed to act upon and turn it into power.  Now is the time to act and make the lasting changes that people have known about for the past 70 years.

I also felt a strong sense of sadness fall over me when watching this lecture, as I truly was unaware of just how long we have known about the damage we are causing to the planet. The fact that many of the same issues being talked about today were discovered over 50 years ago is honestly shocking, especially because, as you stated, it seems that nothing has really changed since then. 

         <br><br>

For example, Ken spoke in the lecture about the people who did attempt to switch to a plant-based diet in the 1970's, stating that they were "marginalized" and "laughed at" for doing so. Unfortunately, it seems to me that those trying to make those types of changes today are met with these same reactions. I have had several experiences with people who act appalled or even confused when I speak to them about seemingly simple lifestyle changes, like a reduction in meat consumption or an increase in their usage of bikes or public transit for their everyday transportation. Despite being constantly told about these environmentally friendly changes, most people just truly don't see a need or reason to alter their current lifestyles, and as much I would love to believe otherwise, it just doesn't seem like this aspect of human nature has changed much in the last 50 or so years. 

         <br><br>

Overall, I also think that this is the time for us to make lasting changes based on what we have known for all these years, i'm just not sure enough people are willing to contribute to those changes.

Personally, I don’t find it very surprising that the Baby Boomer generation knew about the possible catastrophe that would occur if we continued to burn fossil fuels at this rate but still continued to do so. As mentioned in previous lectures, there is a delayed effect on the planet as a result of all the greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, it makes sense that no one was spurred to action in terms of environmental protection, especially with a generation that was already comfortable with their living situation and unwilling to change. 

         <br><br>

Ken’s five suggestions seem simple enough at first glance, but I think it poses more issues than it appears (although by no means is it impossible). He mentions replacing the use of cars with public transportation and bikes, and having smaller homes as well. The easiest way to do so is to move to the city- seems pretty easy right? When considering the Baby Boomer generation, it’s actually much more difficult. I don’t know if we can expect older people to sell their house that they’ve spent their entire life saving up for, and then uproot everything by moving to a city instead. For this reason, I can’t really blame his generation for not taking action in that aspect, but I think they can easily change their diet and reduce consumption.

I agree. When the realities of global warming are in front of people, people will clearly know the huge disaster caused by the continued use of fossil fuels. However, I am also surprised that when people started using fossil fuels in the 1970s, experts had already predicted that it would cause global warming. What shocked me was not only the level of technological advancement at the time but also the persistence of the government's use of fossil fuels despite the fact that they knew the huge potential crisis. Perhaps it was for the development of the economy, technology, and other aspects at that time, but from now on, its consequences are enormous and cannot be compensated.

I find the disconnect from the 1970's environmental activism and today's disregard for the environment puzzling. How can public opinion shift from being informed and aware of the environmental crisis to today's questioning of the validity of the crisis? The peak oil situation should have been enough, in my opinion, to realize the impending effects of climate change and the consequences of depleting Earth's resources. A nationwide shortage of that degree affected everyone, I'm sure, and it should have pushed people in the right direction. I can't help but imagine what society would look like if we had turned down a more sustainable path, how many more species would be alive, and how lush and beautiful our Earth would be. I understand not seeing the consequences and not being inclined to act because of it, but it seems suspect to me that no one did anything? or made any changes. 
         <br><br>


I feel like the inactivity from the "boomer" generation isn't just a cautionary tale, it is still actively affecting us. The people in congress are from the generation that knew about the crisis and did nothing, and the most detrimental part about it is that they control the laws and regulations that get passed, and could actively choose to save the Earth if they wanted to. I don't believe that their reign of actively destroying the planet is over just yet. It's hard to be an environmentally conscious youth looking for change and having the people that caused the issue have all of the power to fix the problem that they created. The media divide, too, is being led by middle-aged men/women as well.

As far as being environmentally conscious in my own life, I find it easy to be sustainable here at UCSB. The dining halls have vegan/vegetarian options, and I ride my bike everywhere. When I am in my hometown, however, is where I find it very hard. My household is not vegan/vegetarian, and they frankly care little about politics and the environment. Collectively, we eat a lot of meat, and drive our cars WAY too much. We do take little steps, such as eating more greens and placing an importance on recycling and not wasting food. I work hard to make changes in my life here at UCSB, and hope those will continue even after I have left, and will stick with me into my adult life. I'm hoping to take a lot from this class, and find more ways to practice environmentally sustainable living.

I too find it baffling how the older generation who were so involved in environmental activism in the seventies and are currently in political control, have lost this sense of environmental consciousness. In my current history class that actually kicks off with the early 1970s, it was evident that Oil Embargo and energy crisis showed that Americans really needed to reevaluate their lifestyles and the way they consume. And yet, for the most part, none of that changed. The same generation that was trying to reject consumer culture in the seventies is still actively taking part in it today. It’s disappointing to see the seventies, which I have always understood as an era of radicalism (continuing from the sixties) as their activism not really culminating into significant change regarding the environment at all. They knew what they were doing was going to negatively affect us in the later generations yet did nothing to effectively change at all. How radical is that?

The American Dream is often thought of as if you work hard, then you will be successful and rich and be happy in life. But how can you show anyone that you are rich or successful without having huge mansions, expensive cars, and steak dinner every night? I think that this is an ideal that most Baby Boomers had, and to an extent, are judging and raising our generation to the same standards. Somewhere along the line of our human lineage, we have made success and consumerism go hand in hand, and thus often our goals in life are to buy stuff and show our wealth. We can't live in a tiny apartment or bike because that would hurt our ego, showing to the world that we might be poor or something. It's what we were raised upon by our parents, who expect us to live a good, successful, and comfortable life. Yeah, in the back of our heads we may know the dire consequences of our materialistic lifestyles, but who cares because we worked hard for it, and so we deserve it. I think it is gonna take a long while to change the definition of success, but until we do, our planet will forever be in danger.

I think this is a really interesting point. Understanding and working with the incentives which drive inaction are particularly important. Understanding how we can potentially shift the American incentive structure to be more supportive of ideals which support less excess will not be easy. I found that the fact that cities were a good example of living conditions which helped manage climate was interesting. Since cities naturally constrain both home size and transportation options, individuals must walk more and commute using public transportation. These natural effects are incredibly important to the reduction of our climate footprint. While this may not be realistic for individuals living in more rural areas, having significant investment in efficient public transportation would be impactful for places such as Los Angeles or the Bay Area where there is a large concentration of people over a very large area, with individuals forced to commute via car due to the size of the respective areas.

I think one thing that can change people's minds is if it becomes "cool" to live an environmentally conscious life. This can be done through advertisements, media, and maybe even shaming people for living extravagant lives. As for the previous generation, I can't really blame everyday people for living the way they did. They, like us, can only live using the resources at their disposal. The food, transportation, and commercial systems in place make it hard to live an eco-friendly life. The change has to come from the top down. If policymakers, CEOs, and other powerful people make institutional change, it will be easier for people to integrate these changes into their everyday lives. Ways we can influence them into doing so are activism, protests, and putting pressure on your local government officials to work towards sustainability.
<br><hr>
I think this idea raises an interesting point in that in order to overcome obstacles fueled by the climate crisis, our generation and those to come after us must dismantle what current Western-defined 'success' looks like. The American Dream, while symbolizing the idea of hope and prosperity for all peoples, seems to have convoluted society's ideals and desires. Until we can redefine what it means to be "successful", it seems that combatting the climate crisis may be out of reach... I thoroughly agree that it would be useful to utilize ad campaigns and media persuasion to reorganize these ideals. This strategy reminds me of tactics utilized after WW2 to help reclaim and solidify American success.
<br><hr>
Yeah I absolutely agree with you. A lot of celebrities are already outspoken activists for climate change (Leonardo DiCaprio, Joaquin Phoenix), and they really help the cause. It is a real shame that these activists are still getting hated on because some people think that these actors don't know enough to be lecturing the public on environmental awareness.

I found it extremely crazy that the affect CO2 had on the environment was at least theorized as early as the 1890s, as your colleague from UCSB claims. However, after those initial findings, it kind of stayed out of the conversation until the middle of the 20th century. At that point, it was brought to the president and he appeared to agree with the sentiments. It is at this point I believe our race began to make mistakes. From here, it was not spread to the general public like it should have been. While of course the profound effects were not yet known, it could have been acted upon anyways. Learning all this makes me a little less angry at the general public of boomers, who could not see the consequences of their actions and thus had no motivation to change. While people did know that fossil fuels were not good for the environment in the 70s as you point out, we were still too dependent on them for everyday life to make a switch. What is sad is that it has been 70 years since we were really made aware of the issue  of climate change, and yet we are still here today behaving the same way. I think this really illustrates your point of knowledge with action being true power, and I hope we can begin to see this action.

We knew about the reliance on fossil fuels and that we have to stop for at least the last 50 years. Many people in the US and the world knew we needed to slow down our meat consumption. We didn't necessarily know these facts in response to climate change. But many scientists wrote guesses on what would happen if we decided to use fossil fuels, and it is surprisingly relevant and accurate to today's knowledge. CO2 was a known problem from the beginning, and people were warned.  
         <br><br>

We knew what we had to do but didn't act. But knowledge is only power when acted upon. Knowledge is not power. We now know we are hurting the planet, but we aren't working on it, and we are squandering the knowledge.


<br><hr>
I agree that it is more fair to be angry with those who were in positions of power during these times than the general public; however, Ken does say that the general public did, in fact, know that they needed to solve the problems that their reliance on fossil fuels was causing. There were two Energy Crises in the 1970s, which directly affected the public, and alerted them to the issue that they had to conserve fossil fuel usage. I also find it interesting that we had presidents like LBJ and Jimmy Carter (put solar panels on the White House) who did believe in climate change from an early point, but were unable to make lasting changes to prevent it. It's scary to think that we currently have a president who has repeatedly made a joke of climate change and refuses to address it, especially that he pulled out of the Paris Agreement. If the government has failed to truly help the climate activism movement, even when we had presidents who did believe in it, then having a climate change denier as a president makes it that much harder to solve anything. 
         <br><br>

I really liked what Ken said about how "if not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered". We have clearly known about this problem for many years now, but we have been squandering this knowledge, rather than using it to prevent destroying our earth permanently. On a different note, many of the people who actually have power are ignoring knowledge on climate change in order to keep their power because for them, power relies on money from the corporations that are the ones causing the rising CO2. In Ken’s video “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do”, he highlights the fact that his generation and other older generations continue to believe that the American Dream is to have as much money as possible and have the freedom to spend it on whatever they want, which mostly includes excessive consumerism. I think it is imperative that we stop seeing things like mansions and nice cars as the only way to prove success because you can be successful and have money while still being sustainable and using that success and money for good, rather than adding to the problem.
<br><hr>
It's surprising to know that the facts that scientists were presenting decades ago had little to no effect on politicians and those that allow carbon emissions. Thinking back to one of the previous videos, it's understandable how the majority of people ignored these claims because of the delay of climate change. Money is in these large industries who continue to frack more and more oil every year, making matters exponentially worse. There are no laws to prohibit the amount of fracking that occurs in the world and each country has their own governmental regulations. The American government's lack of action increases the complexity of solving the problem. Americans, Europeans, and other similar countries will be reluctant to change our ways--the convenience that comes with fossil fuels won't be given up easily, as many of us don't know life any other way. 
         <br><br>
As Professor Hiltner stated, knowledge is power only when acted upon. Americans have this knowledge, and have had it for over a century, yet refuse to make progressive changes. The authorities have ultimately failed us because they have ignored the consequences in order to benefit from the destructive practices. It is in the hands of the people and local governments to take control of the situation before it is too late.
<br><hr>
I also found it these things completely insane just like you said Christian, the fact that we have known that carbon dioxide was not going to be good for environment that early. To me it is even crazier that we have known that the rising carbon dioxide levels were going o be catastrophic (although we had no way of knowing exactly how it would affect us, we knew it was not going to be good), yet we did nothing to prevent its rising levels. If we had started to wean ourselves off of fossil fuels in the past and taught the newer generations to not rely so much on the things that are killing our planet then that would have been amazing, but that didn’t happen. I agree with his statement that knowledge with action is the true power, you cannot just have one because that has proven to be ineffective. Knowledge only gets you so far, and you cannot take action without knowledge. In Professor Hiltner’s other lecture video Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do” showcased ways to cut down our carbon footprint. Unfortunately, humankind is naturally selfish and vain, so cutting simple things out of our lives has two reaction. People either think “oh that is very simple,” or “how dare you try and take away my rights,” as Hiltner mentioned in the video. It is insane how we have come to the point in our lives that in order to help our environment we need to have less kids. Although I understand why, it is still sad for those who have always dreamed of having large families being told “you need to only have one kid if any, if you care about our planet.” Overall I enjoyed this lecture video and found it helpful for those wanting to make a difference environmentally.
<br><hr>
I agree the fact that people have been ignoring the issue since way before our lifetime. I do believe the delay played a big part in the rush to take action. But the main issue is how a lot of boomers refuse to take action now. They control our government which is why nothing is being done. They refuse the climate crisis severity if not its existence at all. Had we taken action when it was first noticed we definitely would not be in the position that we are in today.

I was surprised to find out that so much similar information to help the environment was out at a very early time. This made me wonder if we (the ones watching the video) are going to take action after knowing what will happen if we don’t. Living on campus it makes it easy to live a more sustainable life as the way of transportation is walking or biking and we have salad bars at the dining commons. The difficult part is when we are back at home and can’t walk to certain destinations so we opt for an Uber or we go to a family dinner and eat meat. It also made me wonder how much of an effect will it have if we are changing our diets when the dining commons are still serving a large amount of meat options. I know the logical reasoning is that if people stop eating as much meat then it will reflect to the people at the dining common and they will produce less options with meat but I feel like so much food is already wasted on a daily basis there that goes untouched by students. I feel like at least from UCSB we can try to work a way for the dining commons to reduce the amount of meat they serve and at least make a difference in that way. This video left me thinking of way that I can start making a difference and I hope others will take the initiative as well.

I fully agree that the UCSB dining commons could be doing more, however I think that it could be done differently than simply cutting the meat out of the options. The UCSB dining commons throw away an incredible amount of food every day, and unfortunately, due to a sanitation liability issue, isn’t permitted to donate the food either. An excellent first step to address the issue of the dining commons would be to find out how to effectively and safely donate the food to homeless shelters or those in need. 
          <br><br>
To further this point, It is important to note that on average, roughly 40% of all the food that is produced in the USA goes to waste. We talk about global food insecurity while simultaneously throwing away almost half of what we produce. We talk about food production using massive amounts of water and producing methane at unsustainable levels and yet we still continue to waste an incredible amount of food. I think this among many, is a major issue that we as a society need to address for the future well being of the planet and its inhabitants.
<br><hr>
 I was also surprised at the fact that this information was available that long ago. I agree with your point about meat in the dining commons. Something I feel will help people transition away from meat, more than simply taking away meat options, is providing more/better vegetarian options. If there are 20 vegetarian options that suck, and we take away all meat options but two, people are still going to eat the meat. I think that in order to enact change for vegetarianism, branding is an issue. Right now vegetarianism has many negative connotations. We need to make it seem, for lack of a less corny word, trendy. 

          <br><br>

Watching Ken’s video “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do” gave me some new ways to help our environment on a daily basis. One thing Ken mentioned in his video was the cutting down of meat consumption, as one pound of beef is as much of a carbon footprint as 30 pounds of lentils. Armed with this knowledge, I tried to convince my roommate (also a student in this class), to go vegetarian with me. Unfortunately despite his initial bravado while declaring his intent, he made it less than 36 hours.I hope to see lab grown meat make a great advance in the next decade. Many people I know would sooner lose a limb than give up meat consumption, and moreover many people I know do not see it as their responsibility to make change. They see it as someone else will do it, or even if they recognize the harm their actions may cause, are simply apathetic to it. Humans are inherently selfish, I do not see us giving up these luxuries unless or until more convenient environmentally friendly options will take place. CFC bans only came about because alternative lead compounds were found. People won’t want to give up their cars, unless public transit becomes more convenient than having a car.  I find the 4th recommendation Ken gave to be to kind of upsetting. I recognize the validity in his advice, having less children means less people to contribute to climate change, but it feels dystopian to intentionally chose not to have kids for the sake of our environment.  Ken’s student who “wanted everything their parents had and a whole lot more” is not an uncommon view. Many people here are here because they’re ambitious, because they want more, and because they refused to settle for less. 
          <br><br>

Ken’s second video “What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis - and when we knew it” taught me that for almost half a century, we have known about the greenhouse gas production caused by raising livestock. President LBJ even gave a speech on the potential harmful effects on greenhouse gas emissions. Probably the most surprising thing to me was that gas in the 1970’s cost 36 cents per gallon. In my hometown, gas prices today are closer to 15x that amount. I agree with Ken’s assertion that knowledge alone is not power, but action must be taken after obtaining that knowledge. It is useless to know that we are causing harm, if we do not do anything about it.
<br><hr>
I agree that living on or near campus makes living an environmentally friendly lifestyle easy, however I think this is more because we are forced to rather than making an active choice. Where it becomes a little harder is actively making a choice and willingly forfeiting the pleasures of driving a car and eating meat (if you enjoy eating meat to begin with). However I think if we take habits of living a environmentally sustainable lifestyle that we have at UCSB and then bring that home, it could be used as an example for those in our hometowns to live that same type of lifestyle. Making the five changes Ken suggest really aren't that hard, the hard part is knowing what you are giving up to live that lifestyle for what may seem like nothing. The reason I say this is because in reality one person's change in lifestyle doesn't make a huge difference however if the collective human population made this lifestyle change there would be a profound difference. Therefore there is some sort of trust that other people are making the same changes with you in order to make an impact in the world.
